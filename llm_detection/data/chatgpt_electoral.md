# What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register

1 The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

2 The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

3 The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . .

4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word “state” also refers to the District of Columbia.

5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate’s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .

6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state’s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate’s electors.

7 Most states have a “winner-take-all” system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of “proportional representation.” . . .

8 After the presidential election, your governor prepares a “Certificate of Ascertainment” listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state’s Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer

9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college

10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?

12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .

14 It’s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It’s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

# In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner

15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you’re actually voting for a slate of electors.

16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party’s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed) . . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons.

1) Certainty of Outcome

18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible—--it happened in 2000--—but it’s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012’s election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes—--538—--is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . .

2) Everyone’s President

19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised—to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn’t their president.

 3) Swing States

20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.
4) Big States

21 The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .

5) Avoid Run-Off Elections

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

Dear Senator,

The debate over the Electoral College versus a direct popular vote for the election of the President of the United States is one that elicits strong opinions from citizens across the nation. While some argue for the abolition of the Electoral College, as outlined in Bradford Plumer's article, "The Indefensible Electoral College," and supported by figures like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole, there are compelling reasons, as articulated by Judge Richard A. Posner in "In Defense of the Electoral College," to maintain the current system.

One of the central arguments in favor of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome, as discussed by Judge Posner. The winner-take-all system, employed by most states, reduces the likelihood of disputes over election results, providing a stable and clear transition of power. In contrast, a direct popular vote could lead to more frequent disputes and recounts, potentially undermining the credibility of the election process.

Moreover, the Electoral College encourages presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal, preventing them from focusing solely on specific regions. This ensures that the elected president represents a broad range of interests and enjoys support from diverse geographical areas. A candidate with only regional appeal, as emphasized by Posner, is less likely to be a successful president, and the Electoral College helps to mitigate this risk.

The focus on swing states, a result of the winner-take-all method, is another advantage of the Electoral College. Plumer's concerns about candidates neglecting states with no chance of swinging the vote are valid, but the current system ensures that candidates pay attention to a variety of states, engaging a more thoughtful and informed electorate. This focus on competitive states enhances voter participation and helps to avoid a concentration of campaign efforts in densely populated areas.

Additionally, the Electoral College addresses the political balance between large and small states, as highlighted by Posner. The system ensures that candidates must consider the concerns of voters in both large and small states, preventing the domination of electoral strategies by densely populated regions. This balance is essential for fostering a fair and representative election process.

While Plumer raises valid concerns about the potential for ties and anomalies in the Electoral College system, these issues can be addressed through thoughtful reforms rather than outright abolition. The disaster scenarios he presents, such as faithless electors and the prospect of a tie, are infrequent occurrences, and their impact can be mitigated with careful consideration of the system's flaws.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, while not without its imperfections, plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability, fairness, and effectiveness of the presidential election process. The concerns raised by critics can be addressed through thoughtful reforms that preserve the strengths of the current system. Abolishing the Electoral College, as advocated by some, risks introducing new challenges to the election process without necessarily providing a better alternative.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

(So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?

12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .

14 It’s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It’s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

# In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner

15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you’re actually voting for a slate of electors.

16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party’s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed) . . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons.

1) Certainty of Outcome

18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible—--it happened in 2000--—but it’s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012’s election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes—--538—--is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . .

2) Everyone’s President

19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised—to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn’t their president.

 3) Swing States

20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.
4) Big States

21 The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .

5) Avoid Run-Off Elections

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

Dear Senator,

The debate over whether to retain the Electoral College or switch to a popular vote system for electing the President of the United States is a contentious one, as highlighted by various perspectives. After carefully considering the information from multiple sources, I am writing to express my support for maintaining the Electoral College system.

One crucial aspect of the Electoral College, as elucidated by the Office of the Federal Register, is its role as a compromise between direct popular vote and election by Congress. The founding fathers designed it to strike a balance, preventing the potential pitfalls associated with both methods. The Electoral College process, involving the selection of electors, their meeting, and the subsequent counting of electoral votes, provides a structured and constitutional framework for electing the nation's leader.

While critics, as exemplified by Bradford Plumer's article, emphasize the flaws in the Electoral College system, it is essential to address their concerns systematically. Plumer rightly points out instances of potential disasters, such as faithless electors and ties, but these occurrences are rare and can be mitigated with appropriate reforms rather than complete abolition.

Judge Richard A. Posner's defense of the Electoral College provides practical reasons for its retention. The certainty of outcome, avoidance of runoff elections, and the emphasis on swing states are key advantages that contribute to the stability and fairness of the electoral process. The winner-take-all method, which induces candidates to focus on toss-up states, ensures a more engaged and informed electorate.

Moreover, the Electoral College's requirement for presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal, as highlighted by Posner, prevents them from concentrating solely on specific regions. This ensures that the elected president represents a broad range of interests and enjoys support from diverse geographical areas, fostering a more inclusive presidency.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, despite its imperfections, plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability, fairness, and effectiveness of the presidential election process. Addressing concerns and implementing thoughtful reforms can enhance its functionality without resorting to a complete overhaul. Abolishing the Electoral College, as advocated by some, risks introducing new challenges to the election process without necessarily providing a better alternative.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

# What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register

1 The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

2 The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

3 The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . .

4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word “state” also refers to the District of Columbia.

5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate’s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .

6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state’s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate’s electors.

7 Most states have a “winner-take-all” system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of “proportional representation.” . . .

8 After the presidential election, your governor prepares a “Certificate of Ascertainment” listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state’s Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer

9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college

10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . .

The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

The ongoing debate surrounding the Electoral College and the potential shift to a popular vote system for electing the President of the United States elicits passionate arguments from both sides. Advocates for the Electoral College, as explained by the Office of the Federal Register, emphasize its historical significance as a compromise between direct popular vote and election by Congress. While acknowledging the imperfections, proponents argue that the Electoral College provides a structured and constitutional framework for electing the nation's leader.

Bradford Plumer, in his article, provides compelling counterarguments, citing historical instances and potential pitfalls associated with the Electoral College system. The disaster factor, including the possibility of faithless electors, contested elections, or even ties, raises legitimate concerns about the functionality and fairness of the current system. Plumer asserts that the winner-take-all approach in most states leads to campaigns focusing solely on swing states, neglecting the interests of voters in non-competitive states.

On the contrary, Judge Richard A. Posner defends the Electoral College, emphasizing its practical advantages in his article. Posner argues that the certainty of outcome, trans-regional appeal, focus on swing states, consideration of large states, and avoidance of run-off elections contribute to the stability and fairness of the electoral process. The Electoral College, according to Posner, prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from being elected, ensuring a president with broader national support.

Addressing the concerns raised by critics, Posner acknowledges the lack of democratic pedigree in the Electoral College method. However, he contends that the system, despite its flaws, has practical merits that contribute to the effective functioning of the presidential election process.

In conclusion, the debate over the Electoral College versus a popular vote system is complex, involving historical, practical, and democratic considerations. While critics argue for the elimination of the Electoral College due to perceived unfairness and potential crises, defenders highlight its role in preventing regional candidates and ensuring a more inclusive presidency. Striking a balance between these perspectives and considering thoughtful reforms might be the key to improving the electoral process without resorting to a complete overhaul.

The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .

5) Avoid Run-Off Elections

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

The Electoral College has been a cornerstone of the American presidential election process, established by the founding fathers as a compromise between direct popular vote and election by Congress. While there are compelling arguments against the Electoral College, such as those presented by Bradford Plumer in "The Indefensible Electoral College," there are also substantial reasons, as outlined by Judge Richard A. Posner in "In Defense of the Electoral College," for retaining this system.

One of the primary arguments in favor of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. Posner points out that disputes over the outcome are less likely than in a popular vote scenario. The winner's share of the Electoral College typically exceeds their share of the popular vote, providing a clearer mandate for the elected president. This reduces the likelihood of contested results and enhances the stability of the election process.

Additionally, the Electoral College promotes the idea that the president should have trans-regional appeal, addressing the concern of regional favoritism. A candidate needs a broad base of support across various regions to secure victory, preventing a scenario where a president might disproportionately represent the interests of a single region. This ensures that the president is viewed as a leader for the entire nation, fostering national unity.

The focus on swing states is another beneficial aspect of the Electoral College, as highlighted by Posner. Candidates are encouraged to campaign in toss-up states, leading to increased attention from voters in these areas. This, in turn, promotes a more engaged and informed electorate, with thoughtful voters in swing states having a significant impact on the election outcome.

Moreover, the Electoral College balances the influence of large and small states, mitigating the effects of mal-apportionment in the Senate. As Posner argues, this prevents candidates from concentrating solely on populous states and encourages them to consider the diverse needs of both large and small states.

While critics, as articulated by Bradford Plumer, emphasize the potential for disasters, ties, and unfairness in the Electoral College, Posner provides a counter-narrative that stresses its historical functionality and practical benefits. The Electoral College, by design, has proven to be a stable and effective method for electing the President of the United States, ensuring that the president represents a broad spectrum of citizens.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, despite its imperfections, offers valuable contributions to the democratic process. It fosters a sense of national unity, encourages thoughtful voter engagement, and prevents regional favoritism. As we consider potential reforms, it's crucial to weigh the practical benefits of the Electoral College against the challenges and ensure that any proposed changes enhance, rather than undermine, the fundamental principles of our democratic system.

# What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register

1 The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

2 The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

3 The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . .

4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word “state” also refers to the District of Columbia.

5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate’s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .

6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state’s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate’s electors.

7 Most states have a “winner-take-all” system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of “proportional representation.” . . .

8 After the presidential election, your governor prepares a “Certificate of Ascertainment” listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state’s Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer

9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college

10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?

12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .

14 It’s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It’s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

# In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner

15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you’re actually voting for a slate of electors.

16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party’s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed) . . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons.

1) Certainty of Outcome

18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible—--it happened in 2000--—but it’s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012’s election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes—--538—--is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . .

2) Everyone’s President

19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised—to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn’t their president.

 3) Swing States

20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.
4) Big States

21 The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .

5) Avoid Run-Off Elections

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

Dear [State Senator],

I am writing to express my perspective on the ongoing debate regarding the Electoral College and its role in electing the President of the United States. This matter is of great importance as it directly impacts the democratic process and representation of the American people in the highest office.

The Electoral College, as outlined by the Office of the Federal Register, was established by the founding fathers as a compromise between direct popular vote and election by Congress. Despite its critics, I believe there are compelling reasons to retain the Electoral College, as argued by Judge Richard A. Posner in "In Defense of the Electoral College."

Posner emphasizes the certainty of outcome provided by the Electoral College. The winner's share of electoral votes typically exceeds their share of the popular vote, reducing the likelihood of disputed results and ensuring a clear mandate for the elected president. This stability is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the electoral process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal, preventing them from focusing solely on populous states. As Posner points out, this ensures that the president represents a diverse range of interests and fosters a sense of national unity. Without this system, there is a risk of regional favoritism, which may lead to a less effective and representative presidency.

The focus on swing states, as highlighted by Posner, is another significant advantage of the Electoral College. Candidates are motivated to campaign in toss-up states, leading to increased voter engagement and an informed electorate. This targeted approach ensures that the most thoughtful voters, who are likely to pay close attention to the campaign, have a significant impact on the election outcome.

While critics, such as Bradford Plumer, raise concerns about the potential for disasters, ties, and unfairness in the Electoral College, Posner provides a well-reasoned counter-argument. The historical functionality and practical benefits of the Electoral College must be considered in any evaluation of its efficacy.

In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a crucial role in preserving the stability, representation, and national unity of the American electoral system. While reforms are always worth considering, it is essential to weigh the practical benefits of the Electoral College against the challenges and ensure that any proposed changes enhance, rather than undermine, the fundamental principles of our democratic process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

The question of whether to maintain the Electoral College or transition to a popular vote system for electing the President of the United States has long been a subject of debate. While critics, as exemplified by Bradford Plumer, argue for the abolition of the Electoral College, proponents, as articulated by Judge Richard A. Posner, advocate for its retention, citing practical advantages.

One of the fundamental claims in favor of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome, as pointed out by Posner. Unlike the popular vote, the Electoral College system tends to produce a clear winner with a decisive mandate. The winner's share of electoral votes generally exceeds their share of the popular vote, providing a stable and unambiguous result. This aspect contributes to the overall legitimacy of the election process, reducing the likelihood of disputes over the results.

Posner also contends that the Electoral College fosters the concept of a president for everyone. By requiring candidates to have trans-regional appeal, the system prevents candidates from focusing solely on populous states. This approach ensures that the president represents a diverse range of interests and encourages a sense of national unity. Abandoning the Electoral College might risk regional favoritism, potentially resulting in a less effective and representative presidency.

Moreover, the focus on swing states, as emphasized by Posner, is a compelling advantage of the Electoral College. The winner-take-all method encourages candidates to concentrate their campaign efforts on toss-up states, increasing voter engagement and creating an informed electorate. The attention given to swing states ensures that the most thoughtful voters, who are likely to pay close attention to the campaign, have a significant impact on the election outcome.

However, critics like Plumer raise concerns about the potential for disasters, ties, and unfairness in the Electoral College. The historical instances of disputed electors and the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote, as highlighted by Plumer, present challenges to the system. Nevertheless, Posner contends that these occurrences are rare and that the benefits of the Electoral College outweigh the potential drawbacks.

In conclusion, the Electoral College remains a vital component of the American electoral system, providing stability, representation, and national unity. While acknowledging the criticisms raised by its opponents, the practical advantages, as outlined by Posner, underscore the importance of carefully considering any proposed changes to the current system. Any reforms should aim to enhance the democratic process, ensuring that the fundamental principles of representation and stability are preserved.

4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word “state” also refers to the District of Columbia.

5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate’s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .

6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state’s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate’s electors.

7 Most states have a “winner-take-all” system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of “proportional representation.” . . .

8 After the presidential election, your governor prepares a “Certificate of Ascertainment” listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state’s Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer

9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college

10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?

12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .

14 It’s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It’s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

# In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner

15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you’re actually voting for a slate of electors.

16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party’s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed) . . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons.

1) Certainty of Outcome

18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible—--it happened in 2000--—but it’s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012’s election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes—--538—--is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . .

2) Everyone’s President

19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised—to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn’t their president.

 3) Swing States

20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.
4) Big States

21 The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .

5) Avoid Run-Off Elections

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

Dear Senator,

The question of whether to maintain the Electoral College or transition to a popular vote system for electing the President of the United States has been a long-standing debate. I am writing to express my support for retaining the Electoral College, drawing upon information from various perspectives, including "What Is the Electoral College?" by the Office of the Federal Register and "In Defense of the Electoral College" by Judge Richard A. Posner.

One fundamental aspect of the Electoral College is its role as a compromise established by the founding fathers, as highlighted in the Federal Register. It strikes a balance between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and election by a popular vote of qualified citizens. This compromise is crucial in maintaining the delicate equilibrium between the interests of individual states and the nation as a whole.

While critics such as Bradford Plumer argue against the Electoral College, citing potential disasters and instances of state legislatures defying the will of the people, Judge Posner provides a counterpoint. Posner emphasizes the practical advantages of the Electoral College, including the certainty of outcome. Unlike the popular vote, the Electoral College tends to produce a clear winner, reducing the likelihood of disputes over the results.

Posner also contends that the Electoral College encourages presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal, preventing candidates from focusing solely on populous states. This approach fosters a president who represents a diverse range of interests and ensures a sense of national unity. Additionally, the focus on swing states, according to Posner, encourages candidates to engage with a broad spectrum of voters, creating a more informed and thoughtful electorate.

The Electoral College, as argued by Posner, restores balance in the political influence of large and small states. The winner-take-all method ensures that large states receive attention from presidential candidates during campaigns, preventing the disenfranchisement of voters in smaller states. Moreover, the system avoids the need for run-off elections, simplifying the electoral process and providing a clear and decisive outcome.

While there are arguments against the Electoral College, such as those presented by Plumer, it is essential to consider the practical benefits outlined by Posner. The system has proven its stability and ability to represent a diverse range of interests across the nation. Therefore, I urge you to consider these factors when deliberating on any potential changes to the current electoral process.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

The question of whether the United States should maintain the Electoral College or transition to a popular vote system for electing the President has been a persistent topic of debate. While some argue that the Electoral College is outdated and unfair, there are compelling reasons to support its continuation, as outlined by the Office of the Federal Register and Judge Richard A. Posner.

The Electoral College, as described by the Federal Register, was established as a compromise between the election of the President by Congress and a popular vote. This compromise aimed to balance the interests of individual states and the nation as a whole. The process involves the selection of electors, their meeting to vote for the President and Vice President, and the subsequent counting of electoral votes by Congress. The number of electors is determined by a state's Congressional delegation, providing each state with a proportional representation in the electoral process.

Critics, as articulated by Bradford Plumer, contend that the Electoral College system is flawed, citing instances of potential disasters, "faithless" electors, and the possibility of a tie in the electoral vote. However, Judge Posner offers a different perspective, emphasizing the practical advantages of the Electoral College.

Posner's first point, the certainty of outcome, suggests that disputes over the Electoral College results are less likely than disputes over the popular vote. The winner-take-all system in most states ensures that even a slight plurality in a state leads to a landslide electoral-vote victory, reducing the chances of a contested outcome. Additionally, Posner argues that the Electoral College encourages presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal, preventing them from focusing solely on populous states and ensuring a president who represents a diverse range of interests.

Posner's second point addresses the importance of swing states. The winner-take-all method induces candidates to focus their efforts on toss-up states, where voters are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign. This, Posner argues, results in a more informed and thoughtful electorate, with voters in swing states playing a crucial role in deciding the election.

Moreover, Posner asserts that the Electoral College restores balance in the political influence of large and small states. By preventing candidates from concentrating solely on populous states, the system ensures that voters in smaller states are not disenfranchised. It also avoids the need for run-off elections, simplifying the electoral process and providing a clear and decisive winner.

In conclusion, while there are valid criticisms against the Electoral College, the practical benefits outlined by the Federal Register and Judge Posner suggest that it remains a crucial element of the American electoral system. The system's ability to balance state and national interests, ensure regional representation, and produce a clear outcome makes a compelling case for its continuation. As our nation grapples with the complexities of its electoral process, a thorough consideration of both sides of the argument is essential to make informed decisions about the future of presidential elections in the United States.

13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .

14 It’s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It’s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

# In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner

15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you’re actually voting for a slate of electors.

16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party’s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed) . . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons.

1) Certainty of Outcome

18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible—--it happened in 2000--—but it’s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012’s election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes—--538—--is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . .

2) Everyone’s President

19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised—to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn’t their president.

 3) Swing States

20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.
4) Big States

21 The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .

5) Avoid Run-Off Elections

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my strong support for maintaining the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. The Electoral College, established by our founding fathers as a compromise between congressional selection and popular vote, serves as a critical institution that balances the interests of individual states and ensures a fair representation of diverse regions.

One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College, as outlined by the Office of the Federal Register, is its ability to provide each state with proportional representation. The allocation of electors based on the state's Congressional delegation, combining the number of representatives and senators, prevents larger states from overshadowing the voices of smaller states. This ensures that candidates must appeal to a broad spectrum of regions, fostering a more inclusive and representative electoral process.

Additionally, the winner-take-all system, mentioned by the Federal Register and supported by Judge Posner, contributes to the certainty of outcomes. The Electoral College minimizes the likelihood of contested results by translating even slight popular vote pluralities into decisive electoral victories. This system reduces the potential for post-election disputes, creating stability and confidence in the electoral process.

While critics, as cited in Bradford Plumer's article, argue that the Electoral College is prone to disaster, historical instances of such disasters are rare. The safeguards in place, including state laws that vary on elector selection and responsibilities, make it a robust system that has weathered various challenges throughout history.

Judge Posner further argues that the Electoral College promotes trans-regional appeal for presidential candidates. By preventing candidates from concentrating solely on populous states, it encourages them to campaign across diverse regions, ensuring that the President represents a broad spectrum of interests. This approach prevents regional favorites from neglecting states where they are assured of victory.

Another crucial aspect emphasized by Judge Posner is the importance of swing states. The winner-take-all method induces candidates to focus on toss-up states, where voters are more likely to be engaged and informed. This ensures that the most thoughtful voters, those in swing states, play a pivotal role in deciding the election.

Moreover, the Electoral College balances the political influence of large and small states, as highlighted by Judge Posner. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, which could lead to the dominance of larger states, is mitigated by the Electoral College. This prevents candidates from overlooking smaller states and guarantees that they receive attention and consideration during campaigns.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, despite its imperfections, stands as a vital component of our democratic process. Its ability to balance state interests, provide certainty of outcomes, and encourage trans-regional appeal makes it a reliable and effective method for electing the President. As you deliberate on matters related to our electoral system, I urge you to consider the well-founded arguments in favor of the Electoral College and its enduring contributions to our democratic principles.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

# What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register

1 The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

2 The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

3 The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . .

4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word “state” also refers to the District of Columbia.

5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate’s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .

6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state’s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate’s electors.

7 Most states have a “winner-take-all” system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of “proportional representation.” . . .

8 After the presidential election, your governor prepares a “Certificate of Ascertainment” listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state’s Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer

9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college

10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?

12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters.

The Electoral College has long been a cornerstone of the American electoral system, established by our founding fathers as a compromise between direct congressional selection and popular vote. While critics argue for its abolition, contending that it is undemocratic and prone to potential disasters, defenders, such as Judge Richard A. Posner, present compelling reasons to retain this system.

One of the key advantages of the Electoral College, as outlined by the Office of the Federal Register, is its role in maintaining a balance between state interests. The allocation of electors based on Congressional delegation ensures that each state, regardless of its size, plays a significant role in the election process. This prevents larger states from overshadowing the voices of smaller states and promotes a more inclusive representation of the diverse interests across the nation.

Critics, as highlighted in Bradford Plumer's article, argue that the Electoral College is prone to disasters, citing historical instances of potential chaos. However, it is essential to recognize that these instances are rare and that the system has demonstrated resilience over the years. Safeguards, such as state laws governing elector selection, have prevented major disruptions and maintained the stability of the electoral process.

Judge Posner, in defense of the Electoral College, emphasizes the certainty of outcomes as a crucial factor. The winner-take-all system ensures that even a slight plurality in a state translates into a decisive electoral victory, reducing the likelihood of disputes. This stability is a significant advantage, providing the American people with confidence in the electoral process and the legitimacy of the elected president.

Moreover, the Electoral College encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal, preventing them from concentrating solely on populous states, as discussed by Judge Posner. This ensures that the President represents a broad spectrum of interests and prevents regional favorites from neglecting states where victory is assured. The focus on swing states, induced by the winner-take-all method, also engages voters in these states more actively, making them more thoughtful participants in the democratic process.

In conclusion, while critics advocate for the abolition of the Electoral College, it is crucial to recognize the system's enduring strengths. The balance it brings to state interests, the certainty it provides in outcomes, and its promotion of trans-regional appeal contribute to a robust and inclusive democratic process. As our nation's leaders consider potential changes to our electoral system, these advantages should be weighed against the arguments for reform to ensure the continued effectiveness and fairness of our democracy.

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

The Electoral College has been a fundamental element of the American electoral system since its inception, designed by the founding fathers as a compromise between congressional selection and a popular vote of qualified citizens. As we contemplate potential changes to our presidential election process, it is essential to weigh the advantages of the Electoral College against the arguments for its abolition.

One of the primary strengths of the Electoral College, as highlighted by the Office of the Federal Register, lies in its role in balancing state interests. The allocation of electors based on Congressional delegation ensures that each state, regardless of size, plays a significant role in the election process. This prevents larger states from overshadowing the voices of smaller states and promotes a more inclusive representation of the diverse interests across the nation.

Critics, including Bradford Plumer, argue for the abolition of the Electoral College, pointing to potential disasters and historical instances of chaos. However, it is crucial to recognize that these instances are rare and that the system has demonstrated resilience over the years. Safeguards, such as state laws governing elector selection, have prevented major disruptions and maintained the stability of the electoral process.

Judge Richard A. Posner, in defense of the Electoral College, emphasizes the certainty of outcomes as a crucial factor. The winner-take-all system ensures that even a slight plurality in a state translates into a decisive electoral victory, reducing the likelihood of disputes. This stability is a significant advantage, providing the American people with confidence in the electoral process and the legitimacy of the elected president.

Moreover, the Electoral College encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal, preventing them from concentrating solely on populous states, as discussed by Judge Posner. This ensures that the President represents a broad spectrum of interests and prevents regional favorites from neglecting states where victory is assured. The focus on swing states, induced by the winner-take-all method, also engages voters in these states more actively, making them more thoughtful participants in the democratic process.

In conclusion, while critics advocate for the abolition of the Electoral College, it is crucial to recognize the system's enduring strengths. The balance it brings to state interests, the certainty it provides in outcomes, and its promotion of trans-regional appeal contribute to a robust and inclusive democratic process. As our nation's leaders consider potential changes to our electoral system, these advantages should be weighed against the arguments for reform to ensure the continued effectiveness and fairness of our democracy.

# What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register

1 The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

2 The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

3 The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . .

4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word “state” also refers to the District of Columbia.

5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate’s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .

6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state’s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate’s electors.

7 Most states have a “winner-take-all” system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of “proportional representation.” . . .

8 After the presidential election, your governor prepares a “Certificate of Ascertainment” listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state’s Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer

9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college

10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?

12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .

14 It’s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It’s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

# In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner

15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you’re actually voting for a slate of electors.

16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party’s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed) . . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons.

1) Certainty of Outcome

18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible—--it happened in 2000--—but it’s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012’s election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes—--538—--is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . .

2) Everyone’s President

19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised—to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn’t their president.

 3) Swing States

20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.
4) Big States

21 The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .

5) Avoid Run-Off Elections

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

The Electoral College has been a cornerstone of the American electoral process, intended to strike a delicate balance between a direct popular vote and congressional selection. While some argue for its abolition, citing concerns about fairness and the potential for electoral crises, there are compelling reasons to maintain the Electoral College or consider alternative reforms.

One key advantage of the Electoral College, as outlined by the Office of the Federal Register, is its role in preserving the interests of individual states. The allocation of electors based on Congressional representation ensures that smaller states are not overshadowed by larger ones, promoting a more inclusive and representative democracy. This prevents candidates from focusing solely on densely populated areas, compelling them to address the concerns of a diverse range of states.

Critics, such as Bradford Plumer, raise valid concerns about the potential for disaster within the Electoral College system. Instances of "faithless" electors or the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote are highlighted as potential risks. However, these occurrences are infrequent, and the system has demonstrated resilience in handling such challenges. The winner-take-all approach, while criticized for promoting swing state focus, provides stability and reduces the likelihood of disputed outcomes.

Judge Richard A. Posner, in defense of the Electoral College, emphasizes its role in ensuring a certainty of outcome. The winner-take-all mechanism results in a decisive electoral victory, reducing the chances of disputes over the popular vote. This stability is crucial for maintaining public confidence in the electoral process and avoiding prolonged legal battles that could undermine the legitimacy of the elected president.

Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal, preventing them from concentrating solely on populous states. As highlighted by Posner, this is a desirable outcome as it ensures that the President represents a broad spectrum of interests and prevents regional favorites from neglecting states where victory is assured.

While calls for the abolition of the Electoral College persist, the arguments in favor of its retention or reform are practical and aim to preserve the integrity and stability of the democratic process. As our nation grapples with the question of electoral reform, it is imperative to weigh these advantages against the potential pitfalls, ensuring that any changes enhance the fairness and representation of the American electoral system.

Dear [Senator],

The current debate over the Electoral College versus a direct popular vote for the President of the United States has garnered significant attention and raised valid concerns about the efficacy and fairness of our electoral system.

8 After the presidential election, your governor prepares a “Certificate of Ascertainment” listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state’s Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer

9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college

10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?

12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .

14 It’s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It’s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

# In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner

15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you’re actually voting for a slate of electors.

16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party’s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed) . . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons.

1) Certainty of Outcome

18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible—--it happened in 2000--—but it’s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012’s election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes—--538—--is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . .

2) Everyone’s President

19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised—to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn’t their president.

 3) Swing States

20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.
4) Big States

21 The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .

5) Avoid Run-Off Elections

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

The debate surrounding the Electoral College versus a direct popular vote for the President of the United States has been a contentious one, with valid arguments on both sides. While critics, as exemplified by Bradford Plumer, emphasize the potential flaws and crisis scenarios within the Electoral College system, supporters like Judge Richard A. Posner argue for its retention based on practical reasons. This essay aims to advocate for the preservation of the Electoral College, considering its role in maintaining regional balance, ensuring certainty of outcome, and addressing the concerns raised by both sides.

The primary claim in favor of the Electoral College is its role in preventing the domination of larger states and maintaining regional balance. As elucidated by the Office of the Federal Register, the Founding Fathers established the Electoral College as a compromise between congressional election and direct popular vote. This compromise ensures that smaller states are not marginalized in the presidential election process. Each state's entitled allotment of electors corresponds to its Congressional delegation, including both Senators and House Representatives. This allocation mechanism ensures that candidates must consider the diverse interests of states, fostering a more inclusive democracy.

However, critics, including Plumer, contend that the Electoral College is susceptible to potential disasters, such as faithless electors, tied electoral votes, or a crisis in the House of Representatives. While these concerns are valid, they are exceptional cases rather than the norm. The system has proven resilient in handling such challenges, and the winner-take-all approach provides a clear and decisive outcome, reducing the likelihood of prolonged disputes over the popular vote.

Posner emphasizes the practical reasons for retaining the Electoral College, such as ensuring certainty of outcome. A dispute over the Electoral College outcome is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote, given that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This stability is crucial for maintaining public confidence in the electoral process.

Moreover, the Electoral College encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal, preventing them from focusing solely on populous states. This broad appeal is essential for a successful presidency, ensuring that the elected president represents the interests of a diverse nation rather than catering to a specific region.

While acknowledging the arguments against the Electoral College, such as the winner-take-all system and potential disenfranchisement of voters in non-swing states, it is essential to consider the practical benefits outlined by Posner. The focus on swing states ensures that candidates address a variety of concerns, and the system prevents run-off elections, simplifying the electoral process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, despite its imperfections, plays a crucial role in maintaining regional balance, ensuring stability, and encouraging trans-regional appeal in presidential elections. While considering and addressing the criticisms raised by its opponents, the Electoral College remains a practical and valuable component of the U.S. democratic system.

# What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register

1 The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

2 The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

3 The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . .

4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word “state” also refers to the District of Columbia.

5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate’s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .

6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state’s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate’s electors.

Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my support for the retention of the Electoral College in the presidential election process, based on a careful consideration of various perspectives presented in different sources.

The Electoral College, as described by the Office of the Federal Register, was established by the Founding Fathers as a compromise between electing the President by Congress and a popular vote. It serves as a mechanism to balance the interests of both larger and smaller states, ensuring that no single region dominates the election. The allocation of electors based on Congressional representation helps maintain a fair and inclusive democratic process.

While critics, as outlined by Bradford Plumer, argue for the abolishment of the Electoral College due to potential pitfalls, it is crucial to acknowledge the system's resilience in handling challenges. Instances like faithless electors or tied electoral votes are exceptions rather than the norm, and the winner-take-all approach ensures a clear and decisive outcome, reducing the likelihood of prolonged disputes over the popular vote.

Judge Richard A. Posner, in defense of the Electoral College, presents practical reasons that support its retention. One such reason is the certainty of outcome, as the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College tends to exceed their share of the popular vote. This stability is vital for maintaining public confidence in the electoral process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal, preventing them from focusing solely on populous states. This broad appeal is essential for a successful presidency, ensuring that the elected president represents the interests of a diverse nation rather than catering to a specific region.

The system also promotes a focus on swing states, as highlighted by Posner. Candidates direct their campaign efforts toward these states, encouraging voters to pay close attention to the election. This emphasis ensures that the most thoughtful voters, who are likely to be more informed about the candidates and the issues, play a decisive role in the election.

In conclusion, while acknowledging the concerns raised by critics, the Electoral College, with its emphasis on regional balance, stability, and broad appeal, remains a crucial component of the U.S. democratic system. It provides a balanced and inclusive approach to electing the President, and any potential reforms should carefully consider the valuable aspects it brings to the democratic process.

Sincerely,

The Electoral College has long been a cornerstone of the American electoral system, and its retention is crucial to preserving the delicate balance of power envisioned by the founding fathers. This process, established as a compromise in the Constitution, strikes a harmonious chord between direct popular vote and congressional selection. The intricacies of the Electoral College, as outlined by the Office of the Federal Register, contribute to the stability and representativeness of the presidential election process.

One primary advantage of the Electoral College is its ability to ensure that the president represents a broad spectrum of the nation rather than merely pandering to highly populated urban areas. This is achieved by assigning electoral votes based on the number of representatives a state has in Congress, combining the number of Senators and House members. As a result, candidates must build a geographically diverse coalition to secure victory, preventing a concentration of power in densely populated regions.

Additionally, the Electoral College fosters political stability by discouraging the rise of third-party candidates. The winner-takes-all system in most states prompts candidates to appeal to a broad base, as losing a state means losing all its electoral votes. This discourages the splintering of votes and the formation of factions that could undermine the stability of the political system. In this way, the Electoral College acts as a unifying force, promoting a two-party system that is better equipped to govern effectively.

While some argue for a shift to a popular vote system, such a change could lead to unintended consequences. Critics of the Electoral College point to instances where a candidate could win the popular vote but lose the electoral vote, as seen in past elections. However, it is essential to recognize that the Electoral College is a deliberate design choice, not a flaw. It forces candidates to build national coalitions and consider the interests of a variety of states, preventing them from focusing solely on densely populated urban centers.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, with its roots embedded in the Constitution, is a vital component of the American democratic process. Its intricate design ensures geographic representation and political stability, preventing the tyranny of the majority. While calls for change may arise, it is crucial to consider the far-reaching consequences of abandoning a system that has served the nation well for centuries. The Electoral College remains a bulwark against potential pitfalls and safeguards the principles of fairness and representation envisioned by the framers of the Constitution.

The Electoral College has been a fundamental element of the American electoral system since its inception, serving as a compromise between direct popular vote and congressional selection, as outlined by the Office of the Federal Register. This unique process, embedded in the Constitution by the founding fathers, holds several advantages that contribute to the stability and fairness of presidential elections.

One compelling claim in favor of retaining the Electoral College is its role in ensuring geographic representation. The allocation of electoral votes based on the number of representatives in Congress, combining Senators and House members, prevents candidates from solely focusing on densely populated urban areas. This mechanism fosters a broader coalition-building approach, requiring candidates to consider the interests of diverse states. Abandoning the Electoral College in favor of a popular vote could lead to the neglect of smaller states and rural areas, allowing candidates to concentrate their efforts on population centers, thereby undermining the principle of equal representation.

Moreover, the Electoral College acts as a safeguard against political instability by discouraging the rise of third-party candidates. The winner-takes-all system in most states incentivizes candidates to appeal to a broad base, as failing to secure a state means losing all its electoral votes. This discourages the formation of factions and promotes a two-party system that is better equipped to provide effective governance. While critics argue that the Electoral College may lead to discrepancies between the popular and electoral votes, it is essential to recognize that this system encourages a national focus, preventing candidates from catering exclusively to particular demographics.

Addressing counterclaims, some argue that a popular vote system would be more democratic, ensuring that every citizen's vote carries equal weight. However, such a shift could have unintended consequences, potentially marginalizing the voices of citizens in less populous states. The Electoral College, with its balance between state and population interests, serves as a compromise that respects both majority rule and minority rights.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, established as a deliberate compromise in the Constitution, remains a vital component of the American democratic process. Its role in ensuring geographic representation and promoting political stability makes it a key safeguard against potential pitfalls. While the call for a popular vote system may seem appealing, it is crucial to consider the broader implications and potential disparities that may arise. The Electoral College, with its nuanced design, continues to fulfill its intended purpose of providing a fair and representative method for electing the President of the United States.

# What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register

1 The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

2 The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

3 The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . .

4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word “state” also refers to the District of Columbia.

5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate’s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .

The Electoral College, as established by the founding fathers in the Constitution, stands as a pivotal and deliberate compromise in the election of the President of the United States. This unique process, outlined by the Office of the Federal Register, strikes a balance between the election by Congress and direct popular vote. While some argue for a shift towards a popular vote system, maintaining the Electoral College is crucial to preserving the principles of geographic representation, political stability, and minority rights.

One of the primary strengths of the Electoral College is its role in ensuring geographic representation. By allocating electoral votes based on the number of representatives in Congress, including both Senators and House members, the system prevents candidates from concentrating their efforts solely in densely populated urban areas. This mechanism encourages candidates to build broad national coalitions, taking into account the diverse interests of various states. A move towards a popular vote system could risk neglecting the concerns of smaller states and rural areas, potentially leading to a system where candidates cater predominantly to the preferences of densely populated regions.

Moreover, the Electoral College acts as a stabilizing force by discouraging the rise of third-party candidates. The winner-takes-all system in most states incentivizes candidates to appeal to a broad base, as losing a state means losing all its electoral votes. This discourages the formation of factions and promotes a two-party system, which is often better equipped to provide effective governance. While critics may highlight instances where the popular and electoral votes diverge, it is essential to recognize that the Electoral College encourages candidates to consider a national constituency, preventing the exploitation of regional preferences.

Addressing counterclaims, some argue that a popular vote system would be more democratic, ensuring that every citizen's vote carries equal weight. However, such a shift could inadvertently marginalize the voices of citizens in less populous states. The Electoral College, by balancing state and population interests, serves as a compromise that respects both majority rule and minority rights, thereby upholding the principles of a representative democracy.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, deeply rooted in the Constitution, remains a vital element of the American democratic process. Its nuanced design ensures geographic representation, political stability, and a balance between majority and minority interests. While calls for a popular vote system may arise, it is essential to consider the potential consequences and disparities that may emerge, as the Electoral College continues to fulfill its intended purpose of providing a fair and representative method for electing the President of the United States.

# In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner

15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you’re actually voting for a slate of electors.

16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party’s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed) . . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons.

1) Certainty of Outcome

18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible—--it happened in 2000--—but it’s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012’s election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes—--538—--is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . .

2) Everyone’s President

19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised—to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn’t their president.

 3) Swing States

20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.
4) Big States

21 The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .

5) Avoid Run-Off Elections

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

The question of whether to retain the Electoral College or shift to a popular vote system is a topic of ongoing debate, with valid arguments on both sides. In Defense of the Electoral College, Judge Richard A. Posner outlines five practical reasons to maintain this system, emphasizing its benefits in terms of certainty of outcome, the need for trans-regional appeal, the focus on swing states, the consideration of big states, and the avoidance of run-off elections.

One significant advantage of the Electoral College highlighted by Posner is the certainty of outcome. Despite occasional disputes, the Electoral College reduces the likelihood of widespread disputes over election results, as the winning candidate's share of electoral votes typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. This stability contributes to the overall confidence in the electoral process and prevents prolonged post-election controversies.

The Electoral College also encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal, as no single region has enough electoral votes to secure the presidency. This requirement ensures that candidates must appeal to a diverse array of voters across the country, preventing them from solely focusing on specific regions. This trans-regional approach is crucial for fostering a president who represents the interests of the entire nation rather than catering to a narrow demographic.

Posner's argument regarding swing states adds another layer to the defense of the Electoral College. The winner-takes-all method motivates candidates to concentrate their campaign efforts on states where the outcome is uncertain. This focus on swing states ensures that voters in these states are more engaged and informed, as their votes carry greater weight in deciding the election. This targeted attention can lead to a more thoughtful electorate, which is beneficial for the democratic process.

Additionally, Posner highlights the role of the Electoral College in restoring balance to the political weight of large states. Given the mal-apportionment of the Senate, the Electoral College serves as a mechanism to provide larger states with more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns. This attention helps address the potential disenfranchisement of voters in smaller states and contributes to a more equitable representation of diverse state interests.

Finally, the Electoral College mitigates the need for run-off elections by consistently producing a clear winner. This advantage streamlines the election process, reducing the complexity and potential challenges associated with run-off elections, which could arise in a popular vote system if no candidate secures a majority.

While critics may argue that the Electoral College may discourage voters in non-competitive states, Posner contends that voters participate to express a political preference rather than with the expectation of swinging a national election. The engagement of roughly half the eligible American population in the 2012 election supports this claim.

In conclusion, Judge Richard A. Posner presents a compelling defense of the Electoral College based on practical considerations that contribute to the stability, fairness, and representativeness of the presidential election process. While the system is not without flaws, these arguments provide a nuanced perspective on the benefits of retaining the Electoral College in the American electoral landscape.

Dear Senator,

The question of whether to retain the Electoral College or transition to a popular vote system for the election of the President is a matter of considerable debate. While some advocate for a shift to a popular vote, Judge Richard A. Posner presents compelling reasons in defense of the Electoral College. These practical reasons, as outlined in Posner's article, emphasize the system's advantages in terms of certainty of outcome, the need for trans-regional appeal, the focus on swing states, the consideration of big states, and the avoidance of run-off elections.

One crucial benefit of the Electoral College, as highlighted by Posner, is the certainty of outcome.

This stability is attributed to the fact that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College generally exceeds their share of the popular vote. The winner-take-all system in most states further ensures that even a slight plurality in a state results in a significant electoral vote victory, reducing the possibility of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote.

Another significant aspect of the Electoral College is its requirement for presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. With no single region possessing enough electoral votes to secure the presidency, candidates must appeal to a diverse array of voters across the country. This prevents candidates from focusing solely on specific regions and ensures that the elected president represents the interests of the entire nation.

The focus on swing states, induced by the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes, is another advantage outlined by Posner. This focus encourages candidates to concentrate their campaign efforts on states where the outcome is uncertain, leading to more engaged and informed voters. These swing state voters, being likely to decide the election, become the most thoughtful voters on average, contributing to a more informed and engaged electorate.

Posner also argues that the Electoral College restores balance to the political weight of large states, compensating for the mal-apportionment of the Senate. In the 2012 election, for instance, Florida, a large state with a close popular vote, received 29 electoral votes, while the same margin of victory in Wyoming would only yield 3 electoral votes. This ensures that larger states receive more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns.

Lastly, the Electoral College helps avoid run-off elections by invariably producing a clear winner. This advantage streamlines the election process and reduces the complexity associated with run-off elections, which could arise in a popular vote system if no candidate secures a majority.

While some argue that the Electoral College is an anachronism and non-democratic, Judge Richard A. Posner provides five practical reasons in defense of retaining this system.

20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.
4) Big States

21 The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .

5) Avoid Run-Off Elections

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

Dear Senator,

The ongoing debate regarding the Electoral College's role in electing the President of the United States is a critical issue that demands thoughtful consideration. While many argue for the shift towards a popular vote system, Judge Richard A. Posner offers compelling reasons to retain the Electoral College.

Firstly, Posner addresses the certainty of outcome provided by the Electoral College. The winner-take-all method in almost all states ensures that the winning candidate's share of electoral votes exceeds their share of the popular vote. This minimizes the likelihood of disputes, offering a clear and decisive outcome. In contrast, a popular vote system could lead to more disputes over close margins in a nationwide count.

Moreover, the Electoral College encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal, as no single region holds enough electoral votes to secure the presidency. This prevents candidates from focusing solely on certain regions and ensures that the elected president represents a broad national coalition. A candidate with only regional appeal is less likely to be successful, and the residents of all regions feel more included in the national decision-making process.

Posner's argument on swing states further supports the Electoral College. The winner-take-all method incentivizes candidates to concentrate their efforts on states where the outcome is uncertain. This focus engages voters in toss-up states, making them more thoughtful and attentive to the competing candidates, ultimately leading to a more informed electorate.

The consideration of big states adds another layer to Posner's defense. The Electoral College balances the political weight of large states, ensuring that presidential candidates pay attention to the diverse interests of both small and large states. In a popular vote system, smaller states might feel marginalized, and their unique concerns might be overlooked.

Lastly, Posner points out that the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. This prevents the complexity and potential challenges associated with holding additional elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast. The Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner, streamlining the election process.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage voters in non-competitive states, Posner contends that voters participate to express a political preference rather than with the expectation of swinging a national election. The high voter turnout in the 2012 election, despite the perceived lack of impact in non-competitive states, supports this claim.

In conclusion, Judge Richard A. Posner provides a compelling defense for retaining the Electoral College based on practical considerations that contribute to the stability, fairness, and representativeness of the presidential election process. While the system is not without flaws, these arguments offer a nuanced perspective on the benefits of maintaining the Electoral College in the American electoral landscape.

# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer

9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college

10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?

12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .

14 It’s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It’s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

Dear Senator,

The debate over the Electoral College versus a direct popular vote for the presidency is a crucial issue that demands careful consideration. While some, like Judge Richard A. Posner, argue in favor of the Electoral College, Bradford Plumer presents a compelling case against it.

One of the primary criticisms highlighted by Plumer is the inherent complexity of the Electoral College system. Unlike a direct vote, where citizens cast their ballots for a presidential candidate, the Electoral College involves voting for a slate of electors who then elect the president. This multi-step process introduces the potential for confusion, as voters may not fully understand or align with the electors chosen by their state.

Moreover, the disaster factor, as outlined by Plumer, raises significant concerns about the integrity of the electoral process. State legislatures hold the power to choose electors, and historical incidents, such as the 1960 attempt by segregationists in the Louisiana legislature to replace Democratic electors, underscore the vulnerability of the system to manipulation. The possibility of "faithless" electors who vote against their party's candidate further adds an element of unpredictability, threatening the democratic principles of fair representation.

Plumer's argument against the Electoral College extends to the potential for a tie in the electoral vote, leading to a decision by the House of Representatives. This scenario, as demonstrated by historical examples, disproportionately empowers smaller states, giving their single representative as much influence as larger states. This outcome fails to reflect the will of the people, undermining the democratic ideals on which the nation was founded.

Furthermore, Plumer emphasizes the unfairness of the winner-take-all system employed by most states, causing candidates to focus solely on swing states and neglecting others. In the 2000 campaign, 17 states saw no candidate visits, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets did not witness a single campaign ad. This system concentrates power in the hands of a few swing voters, leaving a majority of states and their citizens overlooked in the presidential campaign.

In conclusion, Plumer asserts that the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The arguments in favor of it lack a solid basis in reality, and the drawbacks, as outlined, pose significant threats to the democratic principles of fairness, equality, and representation. It is, therefore, imperative to consider alternatives, such as a direct popular vote, to ensure a more transparent, accessible, and equitable presidential election process.

Dear Senator,

The ongoing debate surrounding the Electoral College versus a direct popular vote for the presidency is of paramount importance to the democratic principles that our nation holds dear. While there are staunch defenders of the Electoral College, Bradford Plumer presents compelling arguments against it in "The Indefensible Electoral College."

One of the primary contentions raised by Plumer is the complexity inherent in the Electoral College system. Unlike a direct popular vote, where citizens cast their ballots for a presidential candidate, the Electoral College involves an intermediary step. Voters cast their ballots for a slate of electors, who then go on to elect the president. This convoluted process, as highlighted by Plumer, can lead to confusion among voters who may not fully comprehend or align with the electors chosen by their state.

Plumer emphasizes what he calls the "disaster factor," a critical argument against the Electoral College. The potential for state legislatures to pick electors who defy the will of the people, as witnessed in the 1960 attempt by segregationists in the Louisiana legislature, poses a significant threat to the democratic process. Additionally, the presence of "faithless" electors who vote against their party's candidate introduces an element of unpredictability and undermines the fundamental tenet of representative democracy.

The prospect of an electoral tie, as discussed by Plumer, raises further concerns. In the event of a tie, the decision falls to the House of Representatives, where each state casts only one vote. This setup disproportionately empowers smaller states, rendering the House's selection unreflective of the overall popular will. The potential for an electoral tie, as illustrated by historical examples, highlights the fragility of the current electoral system.

Plumer also touches upon the unfairness of the winner-take-all system employed by most states. Candidates focus their campaigns predominantly on swing states, neglecting others where they perceive no chance of winning. This approach sidelines voters in non-swing states, as demonstrated during the 2000 campaign when 17 states did not see candidate visits.

In conclusion, Plumer contends that the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The arguments in favor of the system lack a solid basis in reality, and the drawbacks, as outlined, pose significant threats to the democratic principles of fairness, equality, and representation. It is crucial to reevaluate the current system and consider alternatives, such as a direct popular vote, to ensure a more transparent, accessible, and equitable presidential election process.

Dear Senator,

As a concerned citizen, I am writing to express my support for the preservation of the Electoral College system in our presidential elections, despite the compelling arguments presented by Bradford Plumer in "The Indefensible Electoral College." While acknowledging the criticisms raised against the Electoral College, it is essential to recognize its merits and consider the potential drawbacks of alternative systems, such as a direct popular vote.

Proponents of abolishing the Electoral College argue that it is undemocratic, pointing to instances where the popular vote winner lost the presidency. However, the Electoral College has historically provided a level of certainty in election outcomes. Plumer himself acknowledges the rare occurrence of disputed results, emphasizing that such instances are less likely than disputes over the popular vote. The winner-take-all nature of the Electoral College often results in a clear victor, avoiding the need for lengthy and contentious recount processes.

Plumer raises concerns about "faithless" electors and the possibility of state legislatures defying the will of the people. While these are valid points, instances of faithless electors have been infrequent, and the existing legal framework can address such outliers. Additionally, the potential for state legislatures to intervene directly in the selection of electors serves as a safeguard against manipulation by external forces.

The fear of an electoral tie leading to decisions by the House of Representatives is indeed unsettling. However, this scenario is rare, and the Electoral College has mechanisms in place to minimize the likelihood of ties. The winner-take-all principle also ensures that a candidate must have broader geographic appeal, preventing a concentration of influence in specific regions.

Critics argue that the Electoral College is unfair to voters in non-swing states, as candidates primarily focus on battleground states. However, this approach encourages candidates to build trans-regional appeal, as highlighted in the text. It ensures that the president represents a broader spectrum of the population, preventing candidates from concentrating solely on the interests of specific regions.

In conclusion, while Plumer presents compelling arguments against the Electoral College, it is crucial to weigh its advantages in providing certainty, preventing election disputes, and fostering a balanced representation of diverse interests. The existing system, though imperfect, has demonstrated resilience and effectiveness. Rather than outright abolition, a thoughtful and nuanced reform discussion would better serve our democratic ideals.

Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system in our presidential elections, contrary to the arguments presented by Bradford Plumer in "The Indefensible Electoral College." While the criticisms against the Electoral College are valid, it is essential to consider its advantages and carefully assess the potential consequences of transitioning to a direct popular vote.

The Electoral College has been a target of criticism from various political figures, including Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO, all advocating for its abolition. Plumer highlights the 2000 election fiasco, where Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency, leading to public discontent. However, defenders of the Electoral College argue that this system provides a level of certainty and avoids prolonged disputes over the popular vote.

One crucial argument against the Electoral College is what Plumer refers to as the "disaster factor." The possibility of state legislatures picking electors who may defy the will of the people is concerning. Historical instances, such as segregationists in the Louisiana legislature attempting to replace Democratic electors in 1960, underscore the potential for manipulation. However, it's crucial to note that such occurrences are rare, and existing legal mechanisms can address faithless electors or conflicting slates.

The prospect of a tie in the electoral vote leading to a decision by the House of Representatives is indeed worrying. Plumer rightly points out that this could result in disproportionate influence, where a single representative from a less populous state holds as much sway as multiple representatives from more populous states. However, the rarity of ties and the winner-take-all principle help maintain the stability of the system.

Critics argue that the Electoral College is unfair to voters, particularly in non-swing states, where candidates may neglect campaigning due to the winner-take-all system. While this is a valid concern, defenders assert that the Electoral College encourages candidates to build trans-regional appeal, preventing a concentration of influence in specific regions.

In conclusion, while Plumer presents compelling arguments against the Electoral College, it is crucial to weigh its advantages in providing certainty, preventing prolonged disputes, and fostering a balanced representation of diverse interests. Rather than outright abolition, a thoughtful reform discussion should consider preserving the system's strengths while addressing its shortcomings.

# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer

9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college

10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?

12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .

14 It’s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It’s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my strong support for maintaining the current Electoral College system in our presidential elections, despite the criticisms presented by Bradford Plumer in "The Indefensible Electoral College." While it is evident that the system has its flaws, it is equally crucial to recognize the unique benefits it brings to our democratic process.

One primary advantage of the Electoral College is its ability to provide a clear and decisive outcome in presidential elections. Plumer emphasizes the 2000 election fiasco, where Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency. However, such instances are relatively rare, and the Electoral College ensures that the winner takes office with a majority of electoral votes, promoting stability and certainty.

Plumer raises concerns about the potential for "faithless" electors who might go against the popular vote. While this is a legitimate issue, it is essential to acknowledge that faithless electors have been infrequent throughout history, and legal mechanisms exist to address such deviations. The system, by design, allows states to choose their electors, providing flexibility without sacrificing the overall integrity of the process.

The prospect of a tie in the electoral vote leading to a decision by the House of Representatives is portrayed as a significant flaw. Plumer rightly points out that this could lead to disproportionate influence, but it is crucial to recognize that ties are rare, and the winner-take-all principle is an integral part of preserving stability in the system.

One of the most common criticisms of the Electoral College is its perceived unfairness to voters, particularly in non-swing states. Plumer argues that the winner-take-all system leads candidates to ignore states they have no chance of winning. However, defenders of the Electoral College assert that the system encourages candidates to build broad appeal across diverse regions, preventing campaigns from being excessively focused on specific populous areas.

In conclusion, while the Electoral College is not without its flaws, it continues to play a vital role in ensuring a stable and decisive outcome in our presidential elections. Rather than outright abolition, thoughtful reforms should be considered to address the identified shortcomings while preserving the strengths of the current system.

Sincerely,

Dear Senator,

I write to you today to express my firm belief in the preservation of the Electoral College in our nation's presidential elections, notwithstanding the criticisms presented by Bradford Plumer in "The Indefensible Electoral College." While Plumer highlights some concerns, it is important to consider the historical context and the unique advantages that the Electoral College provides to our democratic system.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures that presidential candidates must have broad national appeal. Under this system, candidates are compelled to address the concerns and interests of voters across various states, preventing them from concentrating solely on densely populated regions. This broad engagement fosters a more comprehensive understanding of the diverse needs of the American people.

Plumer raises the issue of "faithless" electors and the potential for state legislatures to defy the popular vote. While these concerns are valid, instances of faithless electors have been rare, and the current legal mechanisms provide a means to address such situations. The flexibility in allowing states to choose their electors also ensures that the process can adapt to the changing needs of our nation.

The prospect of a tie in the electoral vote leading to a decision by the House of Representatives is portrayed as a significant flaw. However, it is essential to recognize that such ties are infrequent, and the winner-take-all principle serves to maintain the stability and decisiveness of the electoral process. While the House's selection may not perfectly reflect the popular vote, it prevents prolonged uncertainty and encourages a timely resolution.

Plumer contends that the Electoral College is unfair to voters, particularly those in non-swing states. However, this winner-take-all system ensures that candidates appeal to a broader range of voters, preventing them from exclusively focusing on a handful of states. While the system is not flawless, abolishing it would risk concentrating campaign efforts in only a few populous regions, neglecting the concerns of citizens in less densely populated areas.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, despite its imperfections, plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability, broad representation, and decisive outcomes of our presidential elections. Rather than outright abolition, thoughtful reforms should be considered to address the identified shortcomings while preserving the strengths of the current system.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

The debate over the Electoral College versus a direct popular vote for the President of the United States has persisted for years, with passionate arguments on both sides. While some argue that the Electoral College system is outdated and prone to potential disasters, others contend that it serves a crucial purpose in preserving the voice of smaller states and preventing concentrated power in densely populated regions.

One of the primary criticisms against the Electoral College, as outlined by Bradford Plumer, is the potential for a "disaster factor." Plumer points out instances where state legislatures could defy the will of the people in selecting electors, as seen in the 1960 attempt by segregationists in Louisiana. The possibility of "faithless" electors further underscores the vulnerability of the system. However, it is essential to note that such instances are rare and have not occurred frequently enough to warrant abandoning the Electoral College entirely.

Plumer also raises concerns about the prospect of an electoral tie, leading to a decision by the House of Representatives. The perceived imbalance in influence among states in such a scenario is a valid concern. However, the rarity of electoral ties diminishes the immediate relevance of this argument. It is crucial to recognize that no electoral system is flawless, and each has its own set of potential challenges.

Furthermore, the claim that the Electoral College is unfair to voters due to the winner-take-all system is a valid concern. Candidates tend to focus on swing states, neglecting others and leaving voters in non-competitive states feeling disenfranchised. However, proponents of the Electoral College argue that it prevents densely populated urban areas from disproportionately influencing the outcome, ensuring a more geographically representative result.

In defense of the Electoral College, it is important to consider the intention behind its establishment. The Founding Fathers sought to balance the interests of both large and small states, preventing the tyranny of the majority. The Electoral College reflects this commitment to preserving the diversity of voices across the nation, ensuring that no single region dominates the presidential election.

While calls for the abolition of the Electoral College have gained momentum, it is essential to acknowledge the potential consequences of a popular vote system. Simply shifting to a direct election may lead to a concentration of campaign efforts in populous urban centers, neglecting the concerns of rural or less densely populated regions. Striking a balance between the two systems or implementing reforms within the existing framework may be a more prudent approach than outright abolition.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, despite its imperfections, serves a crucial role in maintaining a balance between the interests of large and small states. While the concerns raised by critics are valid, it is crucial to recognize the potential pitfalls of a direct popular vote system. Striking a balance that addresses the shortcomings of the current system without sacrificing its fundamental principles may be the key to ensuring a fair and representative presidential election process.

The debate surrounding the Electoral College and the possibility of transitioning to a direct popular vote system for the election of the President of the United States is complex, with both supporters and critics presenting compelling arguments. While critics, as exemplified by Bradford Plumer, argue for the abolishment of the Electoral College, it is crucial to consider the potential consequences and the foundational principles that led to its establishment.

One of the main contentions against the Electoral College is the so-called "disaster factor," as highlighted by Plumer. The fear that state legislatures or electors could defy the will of the people and potentially lead to election crises is a legitimate concern. However, it is essential to recognize that such instances are rare and have not occurred frequently enough to undermine the overall functionality of the system. The historical examples provided, such as the 1960 attempt in Louisiana, serve as cautionary tales but do not necessarily represent systemic failures.

Another concern raised by critics is the possibility of a tie in the electoral vote, leading to a decision by the House of Representatives. Plumer argues that this scenario could result in an imbalance of influence among states. While this is a valid concern, it is essential to note that electoral ties are rare, and the House of Representatives selecting the President is a constitutional safeguard. This mechanism prevents a scenario where densely populated states hold disproportionate sway over the outcome, ensuring a more balanced representation of the diverse interests across the nation.

Critics also assert that the Electoral College is unfair to voters due to the winner-take-all system in each state, which leads candidates to focus solely on swing states. Plumer points out that this leaves voters in non-competitive states feeling neglected. While this is a valid concern, defenders of the Electoral College argue that the system prevents the concentration of campaign efforts in highly populated urban areas. A direct popular vote system could potentially marginalize the concerns of citizens in less densely populated regions.

In defense of the Electoral College, it is important to acknowledge the foundational principles behind its establishment. The Founding Fathers sought to strike a balance between the interests of large and small states, preventing the tyranny of the majority. The system reflects a commitment to ensuring that the voices of citizens from various geographic regions are heard and considered in the presidential election.

In conclusion, while critics like Plumer argue for the abolition of the Electoral College based on perceived flaws, defenders emphasize the system's role in balancing the interests of diverse states. Acknowledging the concerns raised by critics, it is essential to approach potential reforms or changes with caution, ensuring that any adjustments maintain the fundamental principles of fairness and representation that underpin the democratic process. Striking a balance between addressing perceived shortcomings and preserving the integrity of the system is crucial for the continued success of the electoral process in the United States.

The question of whether to maintain the Electoral College or shift to a direct popular vote for the election of the President of the United States is a contentious issue with valid arguments on both sides. While critics, as exemplified by Bradford Plumer, advocate for the abolishment of the Electoral College, it is crucial to consider the counterarguments and the underlying principles that led to its establishment.

Critics argue that the Electoral College is flawed, citing a "disaster factor" wherein state legislatures or electors could potentially defy the will of the people. Historical instances, such as the 1960 attempt in Louisiana, raise concerns about the system's vulnerability. However, these instances are infrequent and serve as cautionary tales rather than systematic failures. The rare occurrence of such situations suggests that the Electoral College, while imperfect, has mechanisms to address potential crises.

Another concern raised by critics is the possibility of a tie in the electoral vote, leading to a decision by the House of Representatives. Plumer contends that this could result in an imbalance of influence among states. While this is a valid concern, it is essential to recognize that electoral ties are rare, and the House of Representatives selecting the President is a constitutional safeguard. This mechanism prevents densely populated states from holding disproportionate sway, ensuring a more balanced representation of diverse interests across the nation.

Critics also argue that the winner-take-all system in each state renders the Electoral College unfair to voters. Plumer notes that candidates often focus on swing states, neglecting non-competitive states and leaving voters feeling disenfranchised. However, defenders of the Electoral College contend that the system prevents the concentration of campaign efforts in highly populated urban areas. A shift to a direct popular vote could marginalize the concerns of citizens in less densely populated regions, leading to an imbalance in representation.

In defense of the Electoral College, it is crucial to acknowledge the foundational principles behind its establishment. The Founding Fathers aimed to balance the interests of both large and small states, preventing the tyranny of the majority. The system reflects a commitment to ensuring that the voices of citizens from various geographic regions are heard and considered in the presidential election, fostering a more inclusive democracy.

In conclusion, while critics advocate for the abolishment of the Electoral College based on perceived flaws, defenders emphasize the system's role in balancing the interests of diverse states. Recognizing the concerns raised by critics, it is essential to approach potential reforms or changes with caution, ensuring that any adjustments maintain the fundamental principles of fairness and representation that underpin the democratic process. Striking a balance between addressing perceived shortcomings and preserving the integrity of the system is crucial for the continued success of the electoral process in the United States.

# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer

9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college

10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?

12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad.

1 The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

2 The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

3 The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . .

4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word “state” also refers to the District of Columbia.

5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate’s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .

6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state’s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate’s electors.

7 Most states have a “winner-take-all” system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of “proportional representation.” . . .

The debate over whether to maintain the Electoral College or transition to a direct popular vote system for the election of the President of the United States is a nuanced issue with strong arguments on both sides. Critics, exemplified by Bradford Plumer, advocate for the abolishment of the Electoral College, citing concerns about its fairness and potential for crises. However, it is essential to consider both sides of the argument to make an informed decision.

Plumer points out that over 60 percent of voters expressed a preference for a direct election in a Gallup poll in 2000. The historical instances of electors defying the will of the people, such as the attempt by segregationists in Louisiana in 1960, and the possibility of a tie in the electoral vote, as highlighted by Plumer, are legitimate concerns. However, these occurrences are rare, and the Electoral College has mechanisms in place to address potential crises, such as the constitutional safeguard of the House of Representatives selecting the President in the event of a tie.

Another argument against the Electoral College is its winner-take-all system, which critics argue is unfair to voters. Plumer notes that candidates focus only on swing states, neglecting non-competitive states. However, defenders of the Electoral College argue that it prevents the concentration of campaign efforts in highly populated urban areas, ensuring a more geographically representative outcome. The winner-take-all system is not without its flaws, but it also serves to balance the interests of states with varying populations.

Additionally, information from another source outlines the process of the Electoral College, emphasizing its role as a compromise between a congressional vote and a popular vote. The 538 electors in the Electoral College represent a majority of 270 electoral votes required to elect the President. Each candidate has their own group of electors, generally chosen by the candidate's political party. The winner-take-all system, present in most states, awards all electors to the winning candidate, while some states adopt a proportional representation system.

In conclusion, while Plumer argues for the abolition of the Electoral College, it is essential to consider the counterarguments and the foundational principles behind its establishment. The system, while imperfect, provides a balance between the interests of states with varying populations. The rare instances of crises or ties are mitigated by constitutional safeguards. As we deliberate the future of the Electoral College, it is crucial to weigh the potential consequences of a direct popular vote system and ensure that any changes maintain the principles of fairness and representation in the democratic process.

The debate surrounding the continuation of the Electoral College versus a shift to a direct popular vote system for electing the President of the United States is a complex and nuanced issue. Advocates for abolishing the Electoral College, such as Bradford Plumer, present compelling arguments highlighting potential crises, historical challenges, and perceived unfairness. However, it is crucial to consider the counterarguments and the foundational principles behind the Electoral College.

Plumer emphasizes the historical consensus among figures like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and organizations such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and AFL-CIO in favor of abolishing the Electoral College. The assertion that over 60 percent of voters prefer a direct election, as indicated by a Gallup poll in 2000, adds weight to the argument against the current system. Plumer further underscores the potential for disastrous scenarios, including faithless electors and the House of Representatives determining the president in the case of an electoral tie.

On the other hand, defenders of the Electoral College, as outlined in another source, argue that the system is a crucial compromise established by the founding fathers. The process involves the selection of electors, their meeting to vote for the President and Vice President, and the subsequent counting of electoral votes by Congress. The allocation of electors based on each state's congressional delegation ensures a balance between states with varying populations. Additionally, the winner-take-all system in most states prevents the concentration of campaign efforts in densely populated areas, promoting a more geographically representative outcome.

While Plumer points out the flaws in the winner-take-all system, defenders argue that it prevents candidates from focusing solely on swing states, ensuring a broader campaign strategy that considers the interests of diverse regions. The rare instances of crises, like faithless electors or ties, are mitigated by constitutional safeguards, emphasizing the system's resilience.

In conclusion, the debate over the Electoral College requires a careful examination of both sides of the argument. While Plumer raises valid concerns about potential crises and fairness, defenders of the Electoral College emphasize its role as a compromise that ensures a balanced representation of states. As we contemplate the future of the electoral process, it is essential to find a solution that maintains the democratic principles of fairness, representation, and protection against potential crises.

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my views on the ongoing debate surrounding the Electoral College and the election of the President of the United States. This issue has been a subject of considerable discussion, with proponents and opponents offering compelling arguments. After careful consideration of various perspectives, I believe that maintaining the Electoral College is crucial for preserving the integrity of our electoral system.

One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College is its ability to ensure that candidates must have broad geographic support to win the presidency. In the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton argued that the Electoral College would prevent candidates from concentrating their efforts solely in populous urban areas, neglecting the concerns and interests of citizens in less populated regions. This system promotes a more inclusive representation of diverse voices across the nation, preventing the dominance of a few densely populated states over the entire electoral process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College acts as a safeguard against the potential manipulation of election results. The distributed nature of the electoral votes makes it more challenging for any single group or entity to tamper with the outcome on a large scale. The Framers of the Constitution designed the Electoral College with the intent of protecting the election process from undue influence and ensuring that the president is elected by a wide cross-section of the American people.

While some argue for the adoption of a popular vote system, it is essential to address the potential drawbacks. Critics of the Electoral College claim that it can lead to situations where a candidate wins the popular vote but loses the electoral vote, as seen in recent elections. However, this occurrence is relatively rare and should be weighed against the stability and representation advantages provided by the current system.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves as a vital component of our democratic process, fostering a balanced representation of diverse interests and preventing the concentration of power in specific regions. While no system is without flaws, the Electoral College has stood the test of time and has successfully contributed to the stability and fairness of our presidential elections. I urge you to consider the historical context and the wisdom of the Founding Fathers in your deliberations on this important matter.

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to share my perspective on a matter of significant importance—the debate surrounding the Electoral College and the possibility of transitioning to a popular vote system for the election of the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I have taken the time to explore diverse viewpoints on this issue and would like to advocate for the retention of the Electoral College, considering its historical underpinnings and its role in maintaining a balanced and representative electoral process.

One primary argument in favor of the Electoral College is its role in preventing the undue influence of densely populated urban areas over the entire election process. The Founding Fathers, in their wisdom, sought to create a system that would require presidential candidates to garner support from a broad geographic spectrum. In Federalist Paper No. 68, Alexander Hamilton emphasized the importance of preventing candidates from focusing solely on highly populated regions and neglecting the concerns of citizens in less densely populated areas. The Electoral College, by allocating electoral votes based on a state's representation in Congress, ensures that candidates must appeal to a diverse range of voters across the country.

Critics of the Electoral College often argue that it can lead to situations where a candidate wins the popular vote but loses the electoral vote, as seen in recent elections. While this is a valid concern, it is essential to recognize that such instances are relatively rare. Additionally, the Electoral College acts as a safeguard against potential election fraud or manipulation. Its decentralized nature makes it more challenging for any single entity to manipulate the outcome on a large scale, promoting the overall integrity of the electoral process.

Moreover, the Electoral College contributes to the stability of the presidential election system. Changing to a popular vote system could introduce new challenges, potentially leading to contested elections and increased polarization. The current system has proven to be resilient over the years, providing a consistent framework for electing the nation's leader.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, as envisioned by the Founding Fathers, plays a crucial role in preserving the principles of fairness, representation, and stability in our electoral process. While the system is not without its flaws, the benefits it provides in terms of geographic representation and safeguarding against manipulation are essential considerations. I urge you to carefully weigh these factors as you deliberate on the future of our electoral system.

This issue is of paramount importance to our democratic process, and after careful consideration, I advocate for the preservation of the Electoral College due to its role in ensuring fair and balanced representation across the nation.

The framers of the Constitution, in their wisdom, designed the Electoral College to require presidential candidates to appeal to a broad geographic spectrum of voters. Alexander Hamilton articulated this in Federalist Paper No. 68, emphasizing the need to prevent candidates from concentrating their efforts solely in populous regions, neglecting the concerns of citizens in less densely populated areas.

Additionally, the Electoral College acts as a safeguard against potential election fraud or manipulation. Its decentralized structure makes it more challenging for any single entity to manipulate the outcome on a large scale, contributing to the overall integrity of the electoral process.

Moreover, the Electoral College contributes to the stability of the presidential election system.

The existing system, despite its imperfections, has demonstrated resilience over the years, providing a consistent and reliable framework for electing the nation's leader.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, as envisioned by the Founding Fathers, plays a vital role in upholding the principles of fairness, representation, and stability in our electoral process. While acknowledging the system's imperfections, the benefits it provides in terms of geographic representation and safeguarding against manipulation should not be overlooked.

Advocates on both sides present compelling arguments grounded in historical context and the framers' intentions. In this essay, I will argue in favor of maintaining the Electoral College, emphasizing its role in preserving a fair and representative electoral process.

While these scenarios are infrequent, they raise valid concerns about the fairness of the process. However, it is crucial to weigh these against the benefits of the Electoral College. Additionally, the decentralized nature of the Electoral College serves as a safeguard against widespread election manipulation, contributing to the overall integrity of the electoral process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College supports the stability of the presidential election system. Transitioning to a popular vote system might introduce uncertainties, potentially leading to contested elections and heightened political polarization. Despite its imperfections, the current system has demonstrated resilience over the years, providing a consistent and reliable framework for electing the nation's leader.

In conclusion, while acknowledging the imperfections of the Electoral College, the system remains a crucial element of our democratic process. Its role in promoting geographic representation, safeguarding against manipulation, and contributing to the stability of the electoral process should not be understated. As our representatives consider the future of our electoral system, a balanced examination of these factors is essential to maintain the principles of fairness, representation, and stability.

~The question of whether to maintain the Electoral College or transition to a popular vote system for the election of the President of the United States is a topic of enduring debate. Advocates for the Electoral College argue that it serves as a vital mechanism to protect the interests of smaller states and maintain a federalist system. On the other hand, proponents of the popular vote emphasize its potential to ensure a more direct and equitable representation of the people's will. In considering these perspectives, it becomes evident that the Electoral College is a fundamental component of the U.S. electoral system that deserves preservation.

One key argument in favor of the Electoral College is its role in preserving the interests of smaller states. The system allocates electoral votes based on a state's representation in Congress, giving even the least populous states a minimum of three electoral votes. This safeguards smaller states from being overshadowed by their more populous counterparts and fosters a sense of balance in the election process. Without the Electoral College, candidates might focus solely on densely populated urban areas, potentially neglecting the concerns and needs of citizens in less populated regions.

Furthermore, the Electoral College maintains a federalist approach to governance, as envisioned by the framers of the Constitution. The United States is a union of sovereign states, each with distinct cultures, histories, and priorities. By incorporating the Electoral College, the Founding Fathers aimed to ensure that the President represents a broad spectrum of interests across states. Eliminating this system in favor of a popular vote might undermine the principles of federalism, diluting the influence of individual states in favor of a more centralized approach.

Despite these arguments in favor of the Electoral College, it is crucial to address concerns raised by proponents of a popular vote system. Critics argue that the current system can result in discrepancies where a candidate wins the popular vote but loses the electoral vote, as witnessed in some past elections. However, it is essential to recognize that such instances are relatively rare and do not necessarily indicate a flaw in the overall functionality of the Electoral College. Additionally, a popular vote system does not guarantee a perfect representation of the people's will either, as it may lead to a concentration of campaign efforts in densely populated areas, neglecting the diverse needs of the entire nation.

In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a vital role in preserving the interests of smaller states and upholding the federalist principles embedded in the U.S. Constitution. While the popular vote has its merits, it is crucial to recognize the value of the Electoral College in maintaining a balanced and representative electoral process. A thoughtful consideration of these factors should guide any decision on the future of the U.S. presidential election system, emphasizing the need to preserve the principles upon which the nation was founded.

~The debate surrounding the Electoral College and the popular vote system for the election of the President of the United States is complex and nuanced. Advocates for the Electoral College stress its role in safeguarding the interests of smaller states and maintaining a federalist approach to governance. On the other hand, proponents of the popular vote argue for a more direct and equitable representation of the people's will. As we consider these perspectives, it becomes evident that the Electoral College is a vital institution that should be preserved.

One compelling argument in favor of the Electoral College is its function in protecting the interests of smaller states. This system allocates electoral votes based on a state's representation in Congress, ensuring that even the least populous states have a voice in the election process. As highlighted by Tara Ross in her book, "The Indispensable Electoral College," this approach prevents larger states from dominating the electoral landscape and guarantees a more balanced representation of the nation's diverse interests. Without the Electoral College, there is a risk of candidates disproportionately focusing on densely populated urban areas, potentially neglecting the concerns of citizens in rural or less populated regions.

Moreover, the Electoral College is integral to maintaining the federalist principles envisioned by the framers of the Constitution. The United States is a union of sovereign states, each with its own unique characteristics and priorities. The Electoral College ensures that the President represents a broad coalition of states, preventing a concentration of power in the hands of a few densely populated regions. In Federalist Paper No. 68, Alexander Hamilton emphasizes that the Electoral College serves as a check against foreign influence and domestic factionalism, reinforcing the stability of the nation's political system.

While critics of the Electoral College argue that it can lead to discrepancies between the popular vote and the electoral vote, it is essential to address these concerns. Instances of such discrepancies are rare and do not necessarily indicate a systemic flaw in the Electoral College. Additionally, as pointed out by John Samples in "The Struggle to Admit Kansas: The Triumph of the Constitutional Idea of the Union," a popular vote system is not without its challenges. It may result in a concentration of campaign efforts in densely populated urban areas, potentially marginalizing the diverse needs of the entire nation.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves a crucial role in preserving the interests of smaller states and upholding the federalist principles embedded in the U.S. Constitution. While the popular vote system has its merits, it is essential to recognize the value of the Electoral College in maintaining a balanced and representative electoral process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College is integral to preserving the federalist principles laid out by the framers of the Constitution.

This decentralized approach aligns with the founders' vision of a union of sovereign states, each with its own distinct characteristics and priorities.

While critics argue that the Electoral College can result in discrepancies between the popular vote and the electoral vote, it is crucial to address these concerns without dismissing the entire system.

~The debate over whether to maintain the Electoral College or transition to a popular vote system for the election of the President of the United States is a contentious and longstanding issue. Advocates for the Electoral College argue that it serves as a crucial safeguard for smaller states and upholds the federalist principles embedded in the Constitution. On the other hand, proponents of the popular vote contend that it ensures a more direct and representative reflection of the people's will. While both perspectives present valid points, I assert that preserving the Electoral College is essential for maintaining a balanced and fair electoral process.

~The ongoing discourse regarding the Electoral College versus a popular vote system for the election of the President of the United States is a nuanced and contentious topic. Advocates for the Electoral College argue that it serves as a crucial protector of smaller states' interests and maintains a federalist structure, as articulated by Tara Ross in "The Indispensable Electoral College" and Alexander Hamilton in Federalist Paper No. 68. Conversely, proponents of a popular vote system contend that it would ensure a more direct and democratic representation of the people's will. After a thorough analysis of these perspectives, I assert that a transition to a popular vote system is essential for fostering a more inclusive and directly representative democracy.

One of the central arguments for the Electoral College is its role in safeguarding the interests of smaller states. Tara Ross emphasizes that the system prevents larger states from dominating the election by allocating electoral votes based on a state's representation in Congress. While this ensures some balance, it does not negate the inherent inequality where a voter's influence is disproportionately affected by their state's population size. Counterintuitively, the Electoral College can marginalize the interests of smaller states in close elections, where candidates focus solely on swing states, neglecting the broader spectrum of the nation's needs.

Furthermore, the Electoral College's alignment with federalist principles, as Hamilton expounded in Federalist Paper No. 68, can be seen as a historical necessity rather than a contemporary advantage. In today's interconnected and rapidly evolving society, a more direct and streamlined electoral process is not only feasible but also arguably more in line with the democratic ideals that underpin the nation's ethos. The Electoral College's role as an intermediary body was crucial in the 18th century when direct communication was challenging, but in the 21st century, the need for such intermediaries is less evident.

While critics argue that a popular vote system might lead to a concentration of campaign efforts in densely populated urban areas, neglecting the concerns of less populated regions, this concern can be mitigated through effective campaign strategies and policies that address the needs of the entire nation. A popular vote system encourages candidates to engage with a broader cross-section of the population, fostering a more representative democracy where every vote carries equal weight.

In conclusion, a transition to a popular vote system is imperative for ensuring a more direct, equitable, and inclusive representation of the people's will. While the Electoral College may have served a purpose in the past, the evolving nature of society and advancements in communication technologies warrant a reevaluation of our electoral process. A popular vote system is more aligned with the democratic ideals on which the nation was founded, ensuring that every citizen's vote contributes proportionately to the election outcome.

~The ongoing debate surrounding the Electoral College and a potential shift to a popular vote system for the election of the President of the United States is a complex issue with strong arguments on both sides. Advocates for the Electoral College argue that it serves as a crucial protector of smaller states' interests and maintains a federalist structure. Tara Ross, in "The Indispensable Electoral College," and Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist Paper No. 68, provide insights into the intentions of the framers of the Constitution, emphasizing the need for an intermediary system to prevent the election of a president susceptible to foreign influence or domestic factionalism.

One primary claim in favor of the Electoral College is its role in safeguarding the interests of smaller states. By allocating electoral votes based on a state's representation in Congress, the system prevents larger states from dominating the election process. This ensures that candidates must consider the concerns and needs of citizens in less populous regions, preventing the potential marginalization of these states. The Electoral College provides a buffer against candidates who might exclusively focus on densely populated urban areas, acknowledging the diversity of voices across the nation.

However, critics argue that the Electoral College can lead to discrepancies between the popular vote and the electoral vote, potentially undermining the democratic principle of one person, one vote. This counterclaim is noteworthy, and it is essential to address the concerns associated with such discrepancies. John Samples, in "The Struggle to Admit Kansas: The Triumph of the Constitutional Idea of the Union," points out that such discrepancies are infrequent and do not necessarily indicate a systemic flaw in the Electoral College. Additionally, he highlights the potential challenges and issues that might arise from a popular vote system.

Another aspect to consider is whether the federalist principles upheld by the Electoral College are still relevant in the contemporary context. While the Electoral College might have served a vital role in the 18th century, the dynamics of communication and governance have evolved significantly. A more direct and streamlined system, such as a popular vote, could be more suitable for the modern era, ensuring that the President is elected by a majority of the entire nation's citizens rather than a specific configuration of states.

In conclusion, the debate over the Electoral College versus a popular vote system requires careful consideration of the principles laid out by the framers, the potential impact on smaller states, and the evolving needs of the nation. While the Electoral College has historical significance and protects the interests of smaller states, it is crucial to address concerns about discrepancies and evaluate whether its role aligns with the democratic ideals of the present day. A thoughtful analysis, taking into account the perspectives from various sources, should guide any decision regarding the future of the U.S. presidential election system, ensuring a fair and representative process for all citizens.

~The ongoing debate surrounding the Electoral College and the potential transition to a popular vote system for electing the President of the United States demands a thoughtful examination of historical context, democratic principles, and the contemporary needs of the nation. Advocates for the Electoral College assert that it safeguards the interests of smaller states and upholds a federalist structure, as outlined by Tara Ross in "The Indispensable Electoral College" and Alexander Hamilton in Federalist Paper No. 68. However, proponents of a popular vote system argue for a more direct and egalitarian representation of the people's will. After careful consideration of these perspectives, I advocate for a shift to a popular vote system, as it better aligns with democratic principles and addresses concerns related to the Electoral College.

One of the central claims in favor of the Electoral College is its role in protecting the interests of smaller states. By allocating electoral votes based on a state's representation in Congress, the system prevents larger states from dominating the election process. This ensures a degree of balance and prevents candidates from exclusively catering to densely populated urban areas, considering the diverse needs of citizens in less populous regions. However, critics argue that the potential for discrepancies between the popular vote and the electoral vote can undermine the democratic principle of equal representation. John Samples, in "The Struggle to Admit Kansas: The Triumph of the Constitutional Idea of the Union," acknowledges these discrepancies but emphasizes their infrequency and argues against dismissing the Electoral College outright.

While the Electoral College may have served a vital role in the 18th century, it is essential to evaluate its relevance in the modern context. The framers designed it as an intermediary body to prevent the election of a president susceptible to foreign influence or domestic factionalism. However, with advances in communication and governance, the need for such intermediaries has diminished. A popular vote system ensures a more direct and streamlined approach, where every citizen's vote carries equal weight, aligning with the democratic ideals on which the nation was founded.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, while historically significant, may no longer be the most suitable mechanism for electing the President in the 21st century. A transition to a popular vote system addresses concerns related to discrepancies, ensures a more direct representation of the people's will, and aligns with the democratic principles foundational to the United States. A careful consideration of historical context, democratic ideals, and the evolving needs of the nation supports the case for adopting a popular vote system for the presidential election.

~The debate over whether to maintain the Electoral College or shift to a popular vote system for electing the President of the United States is a critical issue that requires careful consideration of historical context, democratic principles, and the potential consequences for representation. Advocates for the Electoral College, such as Tara Ross in "The Indispensable Electoral College" and Alexander Hamilton in Federalist Paper No. 68, argue that it safeguards the interests of smaller states and maintains a federalist structure. However, proponents of a popular vote system argue for a more direct and egalitarian representation of the people's will. After a thorough examination of these perspectives, I advocate for a transition to a popular vote system, as it aligns more closely with democratic ideals and mitigates concerns related to the Electoral College.

One of the primary claims in favor of the Electoral College is its role in protecting the interests of smaller states. The system allocates electoral votes based on a state's representation in Congress, preventing larger states from dominating the election process. This ensures that candidates must consider the concerns of citizens in less populous regions, preventing the potential marginalization of these states. However, critics argue that the Electoral College can lead to discrepancies between the popular vote and the electoral vote, potentially undermining the democratic principle of equal representation. John Samples, in "The Struggle to Admit Kansas: The Triumph of the Constitutional Idea of the Union," acknowledges these discrepancies but emphasizes their infrequency and argues against dismissing the Electoral College outright.

~The question of whether to maintain the Electoral College or transition to a popular vote system for the election of the President of the United States is a topic that warrants careful consideration of historical context, democratic principles, and potential consequences. Advocates for the Electoral College, including Tara Ross in "The Indispensable Electoral College" and Alexander Hamilton in Federalist Paper No. 68, argue that it serves as a crucial safeguard for smaller states and upholds a federalist structure. On the other hand, proponents of a popular vote system argue for a more direct and equitable representation of the people's will. After a thorough examination of these perspectives, I contend that maintaining the Electoral College is essential for preserving the principles of federalism, preventing the tyranny of the majority, and safeguarding the interests of smaller states.

One of the fundamental claims in favor of the Electoral College is its role in protecting the interests of smaller states. By allocating electoral votes based on a state's representation in Congress, the system prevents larger states from dominating the election process. This ensures that candidates must consider the concerns and needs of citizens in less populous regions, preventing the potential marginalization of these states. Critics argue that the Electoral College can lead to discrepancies between the popular vote and the electoral vote, potentially undermining the democratic principle of equal representation. However, John Samples, in "The Struggle to Admit Kansas: The Triumph of the Constitutional Idea of the Union," emphasizes that such discrepancies are infrequent and do not necessarily indicate a systemic flaw in the Electoral College.

Moreover, the Electoral College aligns with the federalist principles articulated by the framers of the Constitution. In Federalist Paper No. 68, Alexander Hamilton underscored the need for an intermediate body of electors to prevent the election of a president susceptible to foreign influence or domestic factionalism. The Electoral College acts as this intermediary, distributing power across states and ensuring that the President represents a broad coalition of interests. This decentralized approach helps maintain a balance of power and prevents the concentration of influence in a few highly populated regions.

While a popular vote system might seem more aligned with the democratic ideal of one person, one vote, it poses its own set of challenges. Without the Electoral College, densely populated urban areas could disproportionately influence election outcomes, neglecting the diverse needs of citizens across the entire nation. The Electoral College, by contrast, requires candidates to appeal to a broader geographic spectrum, fostering a more representative democracy.

In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a crucial role in preserving the principles of federalism, preventing the tyranny of the majority, and safeguarding the interests of smaller states. While a popular vote system may appear more straightforward, it risks marginalizing voices outside of densely populated urban areas. A thoughtful consideration of historical context, democratic principles, and the potential consequences for representation supports the case for maintaining the Electoral College in the election of the President of the United States.

~The ongoing debate over the Electoral College versus a popular vote system for the election of the President of the United States is a complex and polarizing issue, with both sides presenting compelling arguments. Advocates for the Electoral College, such as Tara Ross in "The Indispensable Electoral College" and Alexander Hamilton in Federalist Paper No. 68, argue that it serves as a vital safeguard for smaller states and upholds a federalist structure. Conversely, proponents of a popular vote system contend that it would ensure a more direct and democratic representation of the people's will. After careful consideration of these perspectives, I argue in favor of transitioning to a popular vote system, as it aligns more closely with democratic principles, addresses concerns related to the Electoral College, and promotes a fair and equal representation of every citizen's vote.

One central claim in favor of the Electoral College is its role in protecting the interests of smaller states. By allocating electoral votes based on a state's representation in Congress, the system prevents larger states from dominating the election process. This ensures that candidates must consider the concerns and needs of citizens in less populous regions, preventing potential marginalization.

While this was a pertinent concern in the 18th century, the relevance of this intermediary system in the modern era is questionable. Advances in communication and governance have lessened the necessity of such intermediaries, and a popular vote system offers a more direct representation of the people's will.

A popular vote system, in contrast, offers a straightforward and democratic approach where every citizen's vote holds equal weight. It eliminates the possibility of a candidate winning the presidency without securing the popular vote, as has happened in a few instances in the past. The Electoral College can create scenarios where a candidate focuses on swing states, neglecting the broader spectrum of the nation's needs and potentially leading to an unbalanced representation.

In conclusion, transitioning to a popular vote system is crucial for fostering a more direct, democratic, and equitable representation of the people's will. While the Electoral College has historical significance and protects the interests of smaller states, its potential for discrepancies and the changing dynamics of our society necessitate a reevaluation of our electoral process. A popular vote system ensures that every citizen's vote contributes proportionately to the election outcome, aligning more closely with the democratic ideals on which the nation was founded.

Advocates for the Electoral College, including Tara Ross in "The Indispensable Electoral College" and Alexander Hamilton in Federalist Paper No. 68, argue that it safeguards the interests of smaller states and maintains a federalist structure. On the other hand, supporters of a popular vote system contend that it would ensure a more direct and democratic representation of the people's will. After a thorough analysis of these perspectives, I advocate for maintaining the Electoral College due to its role in preserving federalism, preventing the tyranny of the majority, and ensuring a more comprehensive representation across the nation.

One critical claim in favor of the Electoral College is its ability to protect the interests of smaller states. The system allocates electoral votes based on a state's representation in Congress, preventing larger states from dominating the election process. This ensures that candidates must consider the concerns and needs of citizens in less populous regions, preventing their potential marginalization. Despite the criticism that the Electoral College can lead to discrepancies between the popular vote and the electoral vote, John Samples, in "The Struggle to Admit Kansas: The Triumph of the Constitutional Idea of the Union," emphasizes their infrequency and argues against dismissing the Electoral College outright.

Moreover, the Electoral College aligns with the federalist principles articulated by the framers of the Constitution. Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist Paper No. 68, underscored the need for an intermediate body of electors to prevent the election of a president susceptible to foreign influence or domestic factionalism. Although the relevance of this intermediary system in the modern era is debated, maintaining the Electoral College provides a balance of power, preventing candidates from solely focusing on densely populated urban areas and ensuring a more comprehensive representation.

While a popular vote system may seem more aligned with democratic ideals, it introduces its own set of challenges. Without the Electoral College, there is a risk of candidates concentrating their efforts in densely populated urban areas, potentially leading to the neglect of the concerns of citizens in less populous states and regions. The Electoral College, by contrast, requires candidates to appeal to a broader geographic spectrum, fostering a more representative democracy.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, despite its criticisms, plays a crucial role in preserving federalism, preventing the tyranny of the majority, and ensuring a balanced representation across the nation. While a popular vote system may seem more aligned with direct democracy, the potential for neglecting the diverse needs of citizens across the entire nation raises concerns. A thoughtful consideration of historical context, democratic principles, and potential consequences supports the case for maintaining the Electoral College in the election of the President of the United States.

~The debate surrounding the Electoral College versus a popular vote system for electing the President of the United States is a complex and enduring issue with profound implications for the democratic process. Advocates for the Electoral College, such as Tara Ross in "The Indispensable Electoral College" and Alexander Hamilton in Federalist Paper No. 68, argue that it serves as a crucial safeguard for smaller states and preserves a federalist structure. Conversely, proponents of a popular vote system argue for a more direct and democratic representation of the people's will. After a comprehensive examination of these perspectives, I assert that maintaining the Electoral College is essential for preserving the principles of federalism, preventing the tyranny of the majority, and safeguarding the interests of smaller states.

One of the primary claims in favor of the Electoral College is its role in protecting the interests of smaller states. By allocating electoral votes based on a state's representation in Congress, the system prevents larger states from dominating the election process. This ensures that candidates must consider the concerns and needs of citizens in less populous regions, preventing their potential marginalization. Despite criticisms that the Electoral College can lead to discrepancies between the popular vote and the electoral vote, John Samples, in "The Struggle to Admit Kansas: The Triumph of the Constitutional Idea of the Union," emphasizes their infrequency and argues against dismissing the Electoral College outright.

Additionally, the Electoral College aligns with federalist principles articulated by the framers of the Constitution. In Federalist Paper No. 68, Alexander Hamilton underscored the need for an intermediate body of electors to prevent the election of a president susceptible to foreign influence or domestic factionalism. While this was a valid concern in the 18th century, the relevance of this intermediary system in the modern era is debated. However, maintaining the Electoral College provides a crucial balance of power, preventing candidates from exclusively focusing on densely populated urban areas and ensuring a more comprehensive representation.

However, proponents of a popular vote system argue that it offers a more direct and streamlined approach to democracy, where every citizen's vote carries equal weight. It eliminates the possibility of a candidate winning the presidency without securing the popular vote, as has happened in a few instances in the past. The Electoral College can create scenarios where a candidate focuses on swing states, neglecting the broader spectrum of the nation's needs and potentially leading to an unbalanced representation.

In conclusion, while the Electoral College has historical significance and protects the interests of smaller states, the potential for discrepancies and the evolving dynamics of our society warrant a thoughtful reevaluation of our electoral process. A transition to a popular vote system may seem more aligned with direct democracy, but the risk of neglecting the diverse needs of citizens across the entire nation raises significant concerns. Thus, maintaining the Electoral College remains crucial for preserving federalism, preventing the tyranny of the majority, and ensuring a balanced representation in the election of the President of the United States.

Critics argue that a popular vote system might disproportionately favor densely populated urban areas, neglecting the concerns of citizens in less populous states. However, with advances in technology and communication, candidates have the means to address the diverse needs of citizens across the nation effectively.

In conclusion, while the Electoral College has historical significance and protects the interests of smaller states, the potential for discrepancies and the evolving dynamics of our society warrant a thoughtful reevaluation of our electoral process. A transition to a popular vote system may seem more aligned with direct democracy, but the risk of neglecting the diverse needs of citizens across the entire nation raises significant concerns. Thus, adopting a popular vote system for the election of the President of the United States is a necessary step to ensure a more direct, democratic, and equitable representation of the people's will.

~The debate over the Electoral College versus a popular vote system for electing the President of the United States is a pivotal issue that demands a thorough examination of historical foundations and contemporary implications. Advocates for the Electoral College, as exemplified by Tara Ross in "The Indispensable Electoral College" and Alexander Hamilton in Federalist Paper No. 68, argue that it serves as a vital safeguard for smaller states and preserves the federalist structure of the nation. Conversely, supporters of a popular vote system contend that it would ensure a more direct and democratic representation of the people's will. After a careful analysis of these perspectives, I argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College, emphasizing its role in preserving federalism, preventing the tyranny of the majority, and maintaining a balanced representation across the nation.

One key claim in support of the Electoral College is its function in safeguarding the interests of smaller states. The system allocates electoral votes based on a state's representation in Congress, preventing larger states from dominating the election process. This ensures that candidates must consider the concerns and needs of citizens in less populous regions, preventing their potential marginalization. While critics argue that the current system disproportionately favors swing states, leading candidates to focus their attention on a select few, the Electoral College still provides a mechanism for ensuring the inclusion of a diverse range of states in the electoral process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College aligns with federalist principles articulated by the framers of the Constitution, particularly Alexander Hamilton in Federalist Paper No. 68. Hamilton underscored the need for an intermediate body of electors to prevent the election of a president susceptible to foreign influence or domestic factionalism. Though relevant in the 18th century, opponents argue that modern advancements in technology and communication make the intermediary system less pertinent. Nevertheless, maintaining the Electoral College is essential for preserving a balance of power, preventing candidates from exclusively focusing on densely populated urban areas, and ensuring a more comprehensive representation.

On the contrary, proponents of a popular vote system argue that it offers a more direct and streamlined approach to democracy, where every citizen's vote carries equal weight. It eliminates the possibility of a candidate winning the presidency without securing the popular vote, as has happened in a few instances in the past.

In conclusion, while the Electoral College has historical significance and protects the interests of smaller states, the potential for discrepancies and the evolving dynamics of our society warrant a thoughtful reevaluation of our electoral process. The Electoral College remains crucial for preserving federalism, preventing the tyranny of the majority, and ensuring a balanced representation in the election of the President of the United States.

~The Electoral College has been a subject of debate in American politics, with advocates and critics presenting compelling arguments for its preservation or replacement by a popular vote system. Tara Ross, in "The Indispensable Electoral College," and Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist Paper No. 68, argue in favor of the Electoral College as a safeguard against majority tyranny and foreign influence. While these perspectives emphasize the importance of the current system, critics argue for the adoption of a popular vote to ensure a more direct and democratic representation of the people's will.

Tara Ross underscores the role of the Electoral College in preventing majority tyranny, asserting that it encourages presidential candidates to address the concerns of a broad range of states. The allocation of electoral votes based on congressional representation safeguards against the dominance of densely populated urban areas, fostering a balanced representation of diverse interests. This argument aligns with the principles of federalism, promoting the autonomy of individual states in the electoral process.

Similarly, Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist Paper No. 68, defends the Electoral College as a mechanism to prevent the election of a president susceptible to foreign influence or domestic factionalism. The intermediary role of electors serves as a safeguard against potential manipulation or uninformed decision-making by the public. Hamilton's perspective highlights the importance of a system that prioritizes the selection of a president with the nation's best interests at heart.

Despite these arguments, critics of the Electoral College advocate for a shift to a popular vote system to address perceived shortcomings. One major criticism is the potential for a candidate to win the presidency without securing the popular vote, as seen in some past elections. Critics argue that such outcomes undermine the democratic principle of one person, one vote and can lead to a sense of disenfranchisement among voters.

Moreover, the contemporary context raises questions about the relevance of the Electoral College in the age of advanced communication and technology. Critics argue that the original intent of an intermediary body of electors is less pertinent today, given the electorate's increased access to information. They contend that a popular vote system would eliminate the possibility of a candidate winning the presidency without winning the majority of votes, ensuring a more straightforward and equitable representation of the people's will.

In conclusion, the debate over the Electoral College versus a popular vote system reflects a tension between historical safeguards and evolving democratic values. While the Electoral College has its merits in preventing majority tyranny and foreign influence, critics argue for a popular vote system to address perceived inequities and enhance the direct representation of the people's will in presidential elections. The decision on whether to maintain or reform the current system is a nuanced one that requires careful consideration of these competing perspectives.

However, critics contend that it may lead to an unfair distribution of political power and that a shift to a popular vote system would be more democratic.

Proponents of the Electoral College, such as Tara Ross in "The Indispensable Electoral College," emphasize its role in preventing majority tyranny. Ross argues that the Electoral College encourages candidates to address the concerns of a broad range of states, preventing the domination of densely populated urban areas over rural regions. This ensures a more nuanced understanding of the diverse needs and perspectives across the nation, promoting equity in representation.

Additionally, Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist Paper No. 68, highlights the Electoral College's function as a safeguard against foreign influence and domestic factionalism. The intermediary role of electors provides an additional layer of scrutiny, preventing the election of a president who might be susceptible to manipulation or may not have the nation's best interests at heart. This aspect of the Electoral College is crucial in maintaining the integrity of the presidential election process.

Despite these arguments, critics point to potential flaws in the Electoral College system. One significant criticism is the possibility of a candidate winning the presidency without securing the popular vote, as seen in certain historical instances. Critics argue that this outcome undermines the democratic principle of one person, one vote and can lead to a sense of disenfranchisement among voters whose preferred candidate did not win.

Moreover, contemporary critics question the continued relevance of the Electoral College in the age of advanced communication and technology. They argue that the original intent of an intermediary body of electors is less pertinent today, given the electorate's increased access to information. Critics contend that a popular vote system would eliminate the possibility of a candidate winning the presidency without winning the majority of votes, ensuring a more straightforward and equitable representation of the people's will.

In conclusion, the debate over the Electoral College versus a popular vote system reflects a tension between historical safeguards and evolving democratic values. While the Electoral College has its merits in preventing majority tyranny and foreign influence, critics argue for a popular vote system to address perceived inequities and enhance the direct representation of the people's will in presidential elections. The decision on whether to maintain or reform the current system is a nuanced one that requires careful consideration of these competing perspectives.

~The question of whether to maintain the Electoral College or shift to a popular vote system is a contentious issue that requires careful consideration of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. While the Electoral College has been praised for preventing majority tyranny and ensuring the representation of diverse state interests, the call for a popular vote system emphasizes the need for a more direct expression of the people's will. In this letter to my state senator, I argue in favor of preserving the Electoral College, drawing upon insights from Tara Ross's "The Indispensable Electoral College" and Alexander Hamilton's Federalist Paper No. 68, while acknowledging and addressing counterarguments.

Tara Ross, in her work, "The Indispensable Electoral College," eloquently defends the Electoral College as a crucial mechanism for preserving the integrity of the electoral process. She contends that this system protects against majority tyranny, as it requires candidates to build broad geographic coalitions to secure victory. By giving weight to states, not just population centers, the Electoral College ensures that presidential candidates must consider the needs and perspectives of citizens across diverse regions. This prevents candidates from solely focusing on densely populated urban areas, thereby maintaining a balance between urban and rural interests.

Additionally, Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist Paper No. 68, elucidates the Founding Fathers' rationale for the Electoral College. Hamilton argues that this system acts as a safeguard against foreign interference and internal factionalism. The indirect election of the president through electors, rather than a direct popular vote, provides an additional layer of scrutiny and protection. It reduces the risk of a candidate being swayed or manipulated by external forces, ensuring that the president represents the true interests of the American people.

Despite these compelling arguments in favor of the Electoral College, critics often raise the concern that it can lead to an outcome where a candidate wins the presidency without securing the popular vote. While acknowledging this counterargument, it's important to emphasize that the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign across a broad spectrum of states, preventing them from focusing solely on densely populated regions. This ensures a more inclusive representation of the nation's diverse interests.

Furthermore, the Electoral College has proven effective in preventing the proliferation of third-party candidates. With its winner-takes-all approach in most states, the system discourages the fragmentation of votes, promoting a two-party system that tends to be more stable and conducive to governance.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, as defended by Tara Ross and Alexander Hamilton, plays a vital role in maintaining the balance of power and ensuring a fair representation of diverse state interests. While critics point to flaws, the system's ability to prevent majority tyranny, encourage broad coalition-building, and safeguard against external interference should not be overlooked. It is my firm belief that preserving the Electoral College is essential for upholding the democratic principles upon which our nation was founded.

Example 1:
"There has been a fuss about the Elector College. Many people get confused about how it works and if they're satisfied with the whole process. Show we "abolish" the Elector College? Should we keep it? Honestly we should keep it. We the peope have more then enough control on who is chosen for the president of the United States Of America. We don't really vote for the president but our vote impacts the decision.

Many citizens of the United States Of America think their vote doesn matter, it does. Why? Well, first the government is runned by the people. Its very rare to not get the president that has the most popular votes, the last time when the president wasn't chosen was in 1888. It's less likely for the president with the most votes to lose the election. For example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the elector votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney. Plus, almost all states award elector votes on a winnertakeitall basis.

Perhaps, there was no system. Would it be simpler? Yes it would but we have to also be fair, there is 538 electors and a majority of 270 elector votes is required to elect the president. When you are voting for the president ypu want to win,you are actually voting for your canidate's elector. How does the system work? First it's the process that has the selection of the electors , the meeting of the electors where they vote for the president and vice president , and last but not least the counting of electoral votes by congress. Obviously it is kind of confusing because it would be much simpler if the winner would be the one with the most popular votes.

Did you know that the Elector College avoids the problem of elections? They do due to how much pressure the candidte can go through. It can easily complicate the presidential process. For instance, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Elector College 301 and 370 elector votes exactly. When avoiding the elections and campaigns , there a better chance of clear winner.

So there you have it,three main reason's why we should keep the Elector College. We have why the process is important and why we have it. How the process work's because it was confusing to many people , so it's defined and hopefully you'll like to stay and support the Elector College. Your vote does matter."

Example2:
"During my life i have watched many presidential elections on my television. To me the Electoral College on paper should work, Should being the key word. As I read the paragraphs on both why the Electoral College work and does not work I have decides the side with not having the Electoral College.

Historical evidence and evidence from this paragraph piont to not having a Electoral College. One reason for this was when Al Gore lost the presidency but won the popular vote nation wide as stated in Source 2. another piont is that if the people have so munch power over who is voted to be president then how do we have a president that the people did not want the president but the person is still elected, its an outrage! One example of how the Electoral College could be a disaster waiting to happen is that the votes are tied which may seem not likey at first glance but say if the votes are tied the presidency is thrown into the House of Representatives which lets face it, in the end the decision will not be approved by the people and the people will then barely have a say on who gets to be president or not. Another thing is the Electoral College can also be vary bisest towrdes one party or the other. This is evident because if a certain party got more electors than another party which whould led to a canedat from one party have more support then another.

Source 3 talks about how sure thats its possible for their to be a tie in the Electoral College but its unlikely supports what im trying the say in my earlier Paragraph, that even though a tie is unlikely it is still possible to happen the chance is still their. This paragraph also says the everyone is a president but if that is the case then why dose the poeple that "we" vote for the electoral College help vote for the president insted vote for the other canadate is an atrosidy on its own. The winnertakeall system is one that only afects the swing states because if thoughs states have already voted then the staes the already votes whould be for not because the numbers for who gets voted whould be already in favor of one state or another. The fact the larger states have a bigger say in who gets voted on is not fair. the is becuase if all the big states vote for someone and about 14 of the smaller states vote on one end of the scale and the other states vote towrdes the other end of the scale then the ballence whould be off and one side would overpower the other side by fact of shear numbers of votes compared to the other side.

After reading over my responce and the evidence that I have profided form the paragraph hear I have with great pride that i have argued my point across to you that the Electoral College in paper is good but in reality is only a crumbleing castle waiting to fall into the tiny bites and pieces that it should be."

Example 3:
"To who it may concern, With all the problems affiliated with the Electoral College, I believe that the United States should do away with the process. This process by which the president is elected is unfair to those of us who are old enough to vote and understand politics. Another disadvantage is that the system of Electoral College is very confusing to many people.

The worst thing about the Electoral College is that it is just outright puzzling. Men who are running for a spot as a presidential candidate are not voted for by the citizens of that state. They have to gain supporters who then become the electors. Then the people of that state have to vote for the electors, not the person to become a presidential candidate. Voters can't even directly vote for who they want. What if you vote for a slate of electors, who are supposed to be in favor of the presidential candidate you want, but don't vote for him? What happens then? presidential candidates who should actually get a chance at running for president because they didn't get enough electoral votes. This all leads to the next disadvantage of the Electoral College, unfairness.

As stated in an article by Bradford Plumer, "... Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency." The person running for president should be voted for directly by the voters. Someone, such as Al Gore, can get enough of the popular votes, but not enough of the electoral votes becuase they can't swing the votes in some states. This basically means that the majority of the United States would like to have Al Gore as a president, but couldn't because the majority of people in a state didn't want him as president.

To sum it up, the Electoral College should be eliminated from the presidential voting process. People should just directly vote for who they want as president and see where it goes from there."

Dear [State Senator's Name],

Hope this letter finds you well. I'm writing to share my perspective on the Electoral College and why I believe it's essential to keep it in place for electing the President of the United States.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures that every state has a say in the election, preventing candidates from focusing solely on populous states and neglecting the concerns of smaller ones. The winner-takes-all system encourages candidates to campaign in various states, considering the diverse needs and opinions of Americans nationwide. This approach prevents the concentration of power in densely populated urban areas, giving a voice to citizens in rural and less populous regions.

Moreover, the Electoral College promotes stability and avoids the potential chaos of close popular vote outcomes. As history shows, candidates can win the popular vote but lose the Electoral College, as seen in the case of Al Gore in 2000. This system acts as a safeguard against the challenges and controversies that might arise from a purely popular vote, ensuring a clear and decisive outcome.

The Electoral College also simplifies the presidential election process by providing a structured and systematic way of choosing the President. Without it, the process could become more convoluted, leading to potential confusion and disputes. The existing framework, with its steps of selecting electors, their voting, and the subsequent counting of electoral votes by Congress, establishes a well-defined process that contributes to the integrity of the election.

While some argue that the Electoral College is outdated, it effectively preserves the principles of federalism and ensures that states remain integral components of the presidential election. Abandoning the Electoral College could lead to a scenario where a few heavily populated states dominate the electoral landscape, sidelining the interests and concerns of the majority of states.

In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a crucial role in maintaining a fair and balanced approach to electing the President. It upholds the principles of federalism, encourages nationwide campaigning, and provides a clear and structured process. While no system is perfect, the Electoral College remains a key element in preserving the democratic values that our nation holds dear.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

To sum it up, the Electoral College should be eliminated from the presidential voting process. People should just directly vote for who they want as president and see where it goes from there."

Example 4:
"Senator, I believe that voting for the president of the United States should be based off of the popular vote by the people. Not the Electoral College. Voting by the Electoral College does not allow the people to have the final say. It ultimately gives the elector the choice. "The 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century" Bradford Plumer, paragraph 14, it was a disaster factor. The electors went against the will of the people and voted the opposite of what they said. Whose to say something like this can't happen again soon?

Some people say that the Electoral College is a good thing. It allows a certainty of outcome and is a fair, reasonable way to vote for a president. But it is based off of trust, that the elector won't betray the candidate's party and people. Trust. Are you really going to put your vote for the president of your country in someone else hand based off of trust?

Having an elector represent your state based off of population is ridiculous. One elector representing 500,000 people in Wyoming. Wouldn't you sleep better at night if you could represent yourself instead of someone representing you and thousands of other people all at once.

In 2000, a candidate had more popular votes, and less electoral votes and lost! Even though the people had more votes! How do you feel knowing that your vote doesn't even count? "Most states have a winnertakeall' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate"the Office of the Federal Register,paragraph 7. Because of this system, candidates will not spend time in certain states they know they have no chance in winning in. "During the 2000 campaign seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all"Bradford Plumer, paragraph 13 Next time you go into that voting booth, remember that you're not voting for a president, you're voting and are supposed to trust an elector."

Example 5:
"The Electoral College has been established since the founding of our country. It is a system that has been tried and tested to work over the course of centuries. It should be upheld for it's ability to produce a solid outcome, and though it has the possibility of failing it's faults are not worse than the popular vote system, and that the Electoral College fosters a presidency campaign that appeals to multiple regions of the United States. This fair system allows representation of the people's will, just like the rest of our government does.

Faith in a certain outcome of the presidential election ensures that the vote has as little complications as possible, and is a reason the Electoral College is necessary. According to source one, "What Is The Electoral College?", each political party has it's own set of electors that equal the amount of congressional delegates per state. Usually each state has a "winnertakeall" method, so the presidential candidate that gets majority in your state will get all of the electors that represent their party, not just most of them. This is beneficial to the outcome of the election because it makes the ability for a candidate to get majority vote much simpler. There is less of a possibility of a tie, or an outcome where no candidate wins. Source 3, "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep out despised method of choosing president", states that "even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state..." , therefore allowing the candidate to secure all votes to their side, instead of having the votes divided on the line of majority rule, and causing rifts between Electoral College voters.

No system is perfect, and the Electoral College is not exempt from this. "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong", Source 2, argues that a term called disaster factor', or the possibility of imminent disaster due to the Electoral College system, is why the Electoral College system should be abolished. The passage uses individual instances, like the fact that in 1960, segrigationists in louisiana nearly appointed Democratic electors that would vote against their candidate, or that in rare instances, "faithless" electoral voters would vote for the other side. These are starman arguments, using specific instances to come to a conclusion that the whole system should be abolished. While the Electoral College system isn't perfect, neither is the popular vote system. The popular vote system has a higher chance of causing a tie between candidates, and it doesn't have a "winnertakeall" standard. In a tie, the vote would be given to the House of Representatives, which, according to source 2, "..can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people..", as citizens often vote one party in for president and another for Congress.

In addition, the Electoral College fosters a more nationwide appeal for the candidate's campaign. Source 3 brings up the fact that no region in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The "winnertakeall" system further benefits this, because in order to win, candidates have to focus their attention on states where their majority vote is insecure. They will not focus on regions where they have essentially secured the majority rule and therefore secured all the electoral votes. In popular vote, they would have to focus extensively on those regions, as the few that are not in the majority would need convincing. Source 3 goes into detail as to why a regionally picked candidate is not a proper show of the will of the people. It states that "The residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised to feel that thier votes do not count, that their new preident will have no regard for their interests...", and so having a transregional appeal is essential to properly representing the will of United States citizens.

Our Electoral College system should be defended and kept. It has the ability to produce a solid outcome, has flaws but ones that are not more disasterous than other systems, and drives candidates to try and present a national appeal. A single vote does not decide an election, the representation of our people should not be split in half, divided. The Electoral College does its best to give the nation the president it deserves."

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. As a high school student who has taken an interest in the current discussions surrounding the Electoral College, I feel compelled to express my perspective on the matter.

In the ongoing debate over the Electoral College, I am firmly in favor of maintaining this system for electing the President of the United States. The Electoral College, though often criticized, plays a crucial role in ensuring a fair and representative outcome in our presidential elections.

One primary argument in favor of the Electoral College is that it provides a sense of control and representation to the people. While some may argue that the popular vote should be the sole determinant, it's crucial to recognize that the United States is a federal republic, and the Electoral College reflects this federalist principle. The "winnertakeall" system, as highlighted in Source 1, ensures that a candidate who secures a majority in a state receives all of its electoral votes. This method simplifies the electoral process, reducing the likelihood of ties and ensuring a clear winner in each state.

Moreover, historical examples, such as the 1968 election with Nixon and the 1992 election with Clinton, demonstrate that the Electoral College helps avoid potential challenges and complications in the presidential process. Despite having a minority of the popular vote, both Nixon and Clinton secured a majority in the Electoral College, providing a decisive outcome and avoiding prolonged disputes or uncertainty.

One crucial aspect often overlooked is that the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign nationwide, appealing to a diverse range of regions and states. As mentioned in Source 3, no single region in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The "winnertakeall" system prompts candidates to address the concerns and interests of citizens in various states, preventing a scenario where candidates solely focus on densely populated urban areas, neglecting the needs of less populous regions.

While no system is perfect, and the Electoral College has its critics, the alternatives, such as a pure popular vote system, also have significant drawbacks. Source 2 highlights instances of potential disasters or malfunctions within the Electoral College system, but it is essential to consider that these examples are exceptions rather than the rule. The popular vote system has its own challenges, including the risk of ties and the absence of a clear "winnertakeall" standard, potentially leading to a more fragmented and less decisive outcome.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that maintaining the Electoral College is in the best interest of our nation. It upholds federalist principles, ensures a clear and decisive outcome, and fosters a nationwide appeal in presidential campaigns. I appreciate your time and consideration on this matter and hope that you will continue to support the Electoral College.

One reason for this was when Al Gore lost the presidency but won the popular vote nation wide as stated in Source 2. another piont is that if the people have so munch power over who is voted to be president then how do we have a president that the people did not want the president but the person is still elected, its an outrage! One example of how the Electoral College could be a disaster waiting to happen is that the votes are tied which may seem not likey at first glance but say if the votes are tied the presidency is thrown into the House of Representatives which lets face it, in the end the decision will not be approved by the people and the people will then barely have a say on who gets to be president or not. Another thing is the Electoral College can also be vary bisest towrdes one party or the other. This is evident because if a certain party got more electors than another party which whould led to a canedat from one party have more support then another.

Source 3 talks about how sure thats its possible for their to be a tie in the Electoral College but its unlikely supports what im trying the say in my earlier Paragraph, that even though a tie is unlikely it is still possible to happen the chance is still their. This paragraph also says the everyone is a president but if that is the case then why dose the poeple that "we" vote for the electoral College help vote for the president insted vote for the other canadate is an atrosidy on its own. The winnertakeall system is one that only afects the swing states because if thoughs states have already voted then the staes the already votes whould be for not because the numbers for who gets voted whould be already in favor of one state or another. The fact the larger states have a bigger say in who gets voted on is not fair. the is becuase if all the big states vote for someone and about 14 of the smaller states vote on one end of the scale and the other states vote towrdes the other end of the scale then the ballence whould be off and one side would overpower the other side by fact of shear numbers of votes compared to the other side.

After reading over my responce and the evidence that I have profided form the paragraph hear I have with great pride that i have argued my point across to you that the Electoral College in paper is good but in reality is only a crumbleing castle waiting to fall into the tiny bites and pieces that it should be."

Example 3:
"To who it may concern, With all the problems affiliated with the Electoral College, I believe that the United States should do away with the process. This process by which the president is elected is unfair to those of us who are old enough to vote and understand politics. Another disadvantage is that the system of Electoral College is very confusing to many people.

The worst thing about the Electoral College is that it is just outright puzzling. Men who are running for a spot as a presidential candidate are not voted for by the citizens of that state. They have to gain supporters who then become the electors. Then the people of that state have to vote for the electors, not the person to become a presidential candidate. Voters can't even directly vote for who they want. What if you vote for a slate of electors, who are supposed to be in favor of the presidential candidate you want, but don't vote for him? What happens then? presidential candidates who should actually get a chance at running for president because they didn't get enough electoral votes. This all leads to the next disadvantage of the Electoral College, unfairness.

As stated in an article by Bradford Plumer, "... Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency." The person running for president should be voted for directly by the voters. Someone, such as Al Gore, can get enough of the popular votes, but not enough of the electoral votes becuase they can't swing the votes in some states. This basically means that the majority of the United States would like to have Al Gore as a president, but couldn't because the majority of people in a state didn't want him as president.

To sum it up, the Electoral College should be eliminated from the presidential voting process. People should just directly vote for who they want as president and see where it goes from there."

Example 4:
"Senator, I believe that voting for the president of the United States should be based off of the popular vote by the people. Not the Electoral College. Voting by the Electoral College does not allow the people to have the final say. It ultimately gives the elector the choice. "The 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century" Bradford Plumer, paragraph 14, it was a disaster factor. The electors went against the will of the people and voted the opposite of what they said. Whose to say something like this can't happen again soon?

Some people say that the Electoral College is a good thing. It allows a certainty of outcome and is a fair, reasonable way to vote for a president. But it is based off of trust, that the elector won't betray the candidate's party and people. Trust. Are you really going to put your vote for the president of your country in someone else hand based off of trust?

Having an elector represent your state based off of population is ridiculous. One elector representing 500,000 people in Wyoming. Wouldn't you sleep better at night if you could represent yourself instead of someone representing you and thousands of other people all at once.

In 2000, a candidate had more popular votes, and less electoral votes and lost! Even though the people had more votes! How do you feel knowing that your vote doesn't even count? "Most states have a winnertakeall' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate"the Office of the Federal Register,paragraph 7. Because of this system, candidates will not spend time in certain states they know they have no chance in winning in. "During the 2000 campaign seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all"Bradford Plumer, paragraph 13 Next time you go into that voting booth, remember that you're not voting for a president, you're voting and are supposed to trust an elector."

Example 5:
"The Electoral College has been established since the founding of our country. It is a system that has been tried and tested to work over the course of centuries. It should be upheld for it's ability to produce a solid outcome, and though it has the possibility of failing it's faults are not worse than the popular vote system, and that the Electoral College fosters a presidency campaign that appeals to multiple regions of the United States. This fair system allows representation of the people's will, just like the rest of our government does.

Faith in a certain outcome of the presidential election ensures that the vote has as little complications as possible, and is a reason the Electoral College is necessary. According to source one, "What Is The Electoral College?", each political party has it's own set of electors that equal the amount of congressional delegates per state. Usually each state has a "winnertakeall" method, so the presidential candidate that gets majority in your state will get all of the electors that represent their party, not just most of them. This is beneficial to the outcome of the election because it makes the ability for a candidate to get majority vote much simpler. There is less of a possibility of a tie, or an outcome where no candidate wins. Source 3, "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep out despised method of choosing president", states that "even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state..." , therefore allowing the candidate to secure all votes to their side, instead of having the votes divided on the line of majority rule, and causing rifts between Electoral College voters.

No system is perfect, and the Electoral College is not exempt from this. "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong", Source 2, argues that a term called disaster factor', or the possibility of imminent disaster due to the Electoral College system, is why the Electoral College system should be abolished. The passage uses individual instances, like the fact that in 1960, segrigationists in louisiana nearly appointed Democratic electors that would vote against their candidate, or that in rare instances, "faithless" electoral voters would vote for the other side. These are starman arguments, using specific instances to come to a conclusion that the whole system should be abolished. While the Electoral College system isn't perfect, neither is the popular vote system. The popular vote system has a higher chance of causing a tie between candidates, and it doesn't have a "winnertakeall" standard. In a tie, the vote would be given to the House of Representatives, which, according to source 2, "..can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people..", as citizens often vote one party in for president and another for Congress.

In addition, the Electoral College fosters a more nationwide appeal for the candidate's campaign. Source 3 brings up the fact that no region in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The "winnertakeall" system further benefits this, because in order to win, candidates have to focus their attention on states where their majority vote is insecure. They will not focus on regions where they have essentially secured the majority rule and therefore secured all the electoral votes. In popular vote, they would have to focus extensively on those regions, as the few that are not in the majority would need convincing. Source 3 goes into detail as to why a regionally picked candidate is not a proper show of the will of the people. It states that "The residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised to feel that thier votes do not count, that their new preident will have no regard for their interests...", and so having a transregional appeal is essential to properly representing the will of United States citizens.

Our Electoral College system should be defended and kept. It has the ability to produce a solid outcome, has flaws but ones that are not more disasterous than other systems, and drives candidates to try and present a national appeal. A single vote does not decide an election, the representation of our people should not be split in half, divided. The Electoral College does its best to give the nation the president it deserves."

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my views on the ongoing debate about the Electoral College and its role in electing the President of the United States. As a high school student trying to make sense of this complex issue, I have carefully considered various perspectives from different sources.

After reviewing arguments both in favor of and against the Electoral College, I find myself leaning towards the idea of keeping this system. While I understand the concerns raised by those advocating for a shift to a popular vote, I believe the Electoral College serves an essential role in preserving the integrity and fairness of our electoral process.

One key point supporting the Electoral College is its ability to provide a clear and decisive outcome in presidential elections. As highlighted in Example 1, the "winnertakeall" system ensures that a candidate who secures a majority in a state receives all of its electoral votes. This minimizes the chances of a tie and simplifies the process, allowing for a swift determination of the winner. In contrast, a popular vote system, as discussed in Example 2, could lead to ties, potentially throwing the decision into the House of Representatives and diminishing the people's direct influence.

Moreover, the Electoral College encourages candidates to address the concerns of citizens across various regions, promoting a more nationwide appeal. Example 5 explains that no single region in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect a president, making it necessary for candidates to focus on states where their majority vote is insecure. This ensures that candidates do not exclusively cater to densely populated urban areas, providing a more balanced representation of the entire nation's interests.

While I acknowledge the counterarguments, such as those presented in Example 2 about the potential bias of the Electoral College, I believe that the benefits of the system outweigh its flaws. The Electoral College, despite its imperfections, has stood the test of time and reflects the federalist principles upon which our nation was founded.

In conclusion, I urge you to consider the value of the Electoral College in maintaining a fair and decisive electoral process. It provides clarity, prevents ties, and encourages candidates to appeal to a diverse range of regions. While improvements can always be considered, I believe that completely abandoning the Electoral College may introduce new challenges to our democratic system.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I trust that you will make decisions that best represent the interests of the people you serve.

Sincerely,

Write a letter to your state senator in which you argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Use the information from the texts in your essay. Manage your time carefully so that you can read the passages; plan your response; write your response; and revise and edit your response. Be sure to include a claim; address counterclaims; use evidence from multiple sources; and avoid overly relying on one source. Your response should be in the form of a multiparagraph essay. Write your response in the space provided. 

You are a US high school student. Use language fitting an average US teenager, imitating the structure and tone of the examples below. 

Example 1:
"There has been a fuss about the Elector College. Many people get confused about how it works and if they're satisfied with the whole process. Show we "abolish" the Elector College? Should we keep it? Honestly we should keep it. We the peope have more then enough control on who is chosen for the president of the United States Of America. We don't really vote for the president but our vote impacts the decision.

Many citizens of the United States Of America think their vote doesn matter, it does. Why? Well, first the government is runned by the people. Its very rare to not get the president that has the most popular votes, the last time when the president wasn't chosen was in 1888. It's less likely for the president with the most votes to lose the election. For example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the elector votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney. Plus, almost all states award elector votes on a winnertakeitall basis.

Perhaps, there was no system. Would it be simpler? Yes it would but we have to also be fair, there is 538 electors and a majority of 270 elector votes is required to elect the president. When you are voting for the president ypu want to win,you are actually voting for your canidate's elector. How does the system work? First it's the process that has the selection of the electors , the meeting of the electors where they vote for the president and vice president , and last but not least the counting of electoral votes by congress. Obviously it is kind of confusing because it would be much simpler if the winner would be the one with the most popular votes.

Did you know that the Elector College avoids the problem of elections? They do due to how much pressure the candidte can go through. It can easily complicate the presidential process. For instance, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Elector College 301 and 370 elector votes exactly. When avoiding the elections and campaigns , there a better chance of clear winner.

So there you have it,three main reason's why we should keep the Elector College. We have why the process is important and why we have it. How the process work's because it was confusing to many people , so it's defined and hopefully you'll like to stay and support the Elector College. Your vote does matter."

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. As a high school student invested in understanding the intricacies of our political system, I wanted to share my perspective on the ongoing debate regarding the Electoral College and its role in electing the President of the United States.

There has been a lot of talk about whether we should keep or abolish the Electoral College. After careful consideration of various viewpoints, I find myself leaning towards the idea of keeping the Electoral College intact. While I acknowledge the concerns raised by those advocating for a shift to a popular vote system, I believe the Electoral College serves a crucial role in maintaining the fairness and efficacy of our electoral process.

One compelling argument in favor of the Electoral College is that it provides a clear and decisive outcome in presidential elections. The "winnertakeall" system, as mentioned in Example 1, ensures that a candidate who secures a majority in a state receives all of its electoral votes. This minimizes the chances of ties and expedites the decision-making process, providing a swift and clear winner. This system, though not without flaws, has historically delivered results aligned with the popular vote.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to address the concerns of citizens across various regions, fostering a more nationwide appeal. Example 5 highlights that no single region in the United States has enough electoral votes to independently elect a president. This compels candidates to engage with voters in diverse states, preventing them from concentrating solely on densely populated urban areas. In a popular vote system, candidates might disproportionately focus on specific regions, neglecting the concerns of citizens in others.

While I acknowledge counterarguments, such as those presented in Example 2 about potential biases in the Electoral College, I believe the benefits of the system outweigh its drawbacks. The Electoral College, despite its imperfections, has proven to be a stable and reliable method for electing our nation's leaders.

In conclusion, I urge you to consider the value of the Electoral College in maintaining a fair and decisive electoral process. It prevents ties, encourages a nationwide appeal from candidates, and has a historical track record of aligning with the popular vote. While improvements can always be considered, I believe that completely abandoning the Electoral College may introduce new challenges to our democratic system.

What happens then? presidential candidates who should actually get a chance at running for president because they didn't get enough electoral votes. This all leads to the next disadvantage of the Electoral College, unfairness.

As stated in an article by Bradford Plumer, "... Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency." The person running for president should be voted for directly by the voters. Someone, such as Al Gore, can get enough of the popular votes, but not enough of the electoral votes becuase they can't swing the votes in some states. This basically means that the majority of the United States would like to have Al Gore as a president, but couldn't because the majority of people in a state didn't want him as president.

To sum it up, the Electoral College should be eliminated from the presidential voting process. People should just directly vote for who they want as president and see where it goes from there."

Example 4:
"Senator, I believe that voting for the president of the United States should be based off of the popular vote by the people. Not the Electoral College. Voting by the Electoral College does not allow the people to have the final say. It ultimately gives the elector the choice. "The 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century" Bradford Plumer, paragraph 14, it was a disaster factor. The electors went against the will of the people and voted the opposite of what they said. Whose to say something like this can't happen again soon?

Some people say that the Electoral College is a good thing. It allows a certainty of outcome and is a fair, reasonable way to vote for a president. But it is based off of trust, that the elector won't betray the candidate's party and people. Trust. Are you really going to put your vote for the president of your country in someone else hand based off of trust?

Having an elector represent your state based off of population is ridiculous. One elector representing 500,000 people in Wyoming. Wouldn't you sleep better at night if you could represent yourself instead of someone representing you and thousands of other people all at once.

In 2000, a candidate had more popular votes, and less electoral votes and lost! Even though the people had more votes! How do you feel knowing that your vote doesn't even count? "Most states have a winnertakeall' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate"the Office of the Federal Register,paragraph 7. Because of this system, candidates will not spend time in certain states they know they have no chance in winning in. "During the 2000 campaign seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all"Bradford Plumer, paragraph 13 Next time you go into that voting booth, remember that you're not voting for a president, you're voting and are supposed to trust an elector."

Example 5:
"The Electoral College has been established since the founding of our country. It is a system that has been tried and tested to work over the course of centuries. It should be upheld for it's ability to produce a solid outcome, and though it has the possibility of failing it's faults are not worse than the popular vote system, and that the Electoral College fosters a presidency campaign that appeals to multiple regions of the United States. This fair system allows representation of the people's will, just like the rest of our government does.

Faith in a certain outcome of the presidential election ensures that the vote has as little complications as possible, and is a reason the Electoral College is necessary. According to source one, "What Is The Electoral College?", each political party has it's own set of electors that equal the amount of congressional delegates per state. Usually each state has a "winnertakeall" method, so the presidential candidate that gets majority in your state will get all of the electors that represent their party, not just most of them. This is beneficial to the outcome of the election because it makes the ability for a candidate to get majority vote much simpler. There is less of a possibility of a tie, or an outcome where no candidate wins. Source 3, "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep out despised method of choosing president", states that "even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state..." , therefore allowing the candidate to secure all votes to their side, instead of having the votes divided on the line of majority rule, and causing rifts between Electoral College voters.

No system is perfect, and the Electoral College is not exempt from this. "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong", Source 2, argues that a term called disaster factor', or the possibility of imminent disaster due to the Electoral College system, is why the Electoral College system should be abolished. The passage uses individual instances, like the fact that in 1960, segrigationists in louisiana nearly appointed Democratic electors that would vote against their candidate, or that in rare instances, "faithless" electoral voters would vote for the other side. These are starman arguments, using specific instances to come to a conclusion that the whole system should be abolished. While the Electoral College system isn't perfect, neither is the popular vote system. The popular vote system has a higher chance of causing a tie between candidates, and it doesn't have a "winnertakeall" standard. In a tie, the vote would be given to the House of Representatives, which, according to source 2, "..can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people..", as citizens often vote one party in for president and another for Congress.

In addition, the Electoral College fosters a more nationwide appeal for the candidate's campaign. Source 3 brings up the fact that no region in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The "winnertakeall" system further benefits this, because in order to win, candidates have to focus their attention on states where their majority vote is insecure. They will not focus on regions where they have essentially secured the majority rule and therefore secured all the electoral votes. In popular vote, they would have to focus extensively on those regions, as the few that are not in the majority would need convincing. Source 3 goes into detail as to why a regionally picked candidate is not a proper show of the will of the people. It states that "The residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised to feel that thier votes do not count, that their new preident will have no regard for their interests...", and so having a transregional appeal is essential to properly representing the will of United States citizens.

Our Electoral College system should be defended and kept. It has the ability to produce a solid outcome, has flaws but ones that are not more disasterous than other systems, and drives candidates to try and present a national appeal. A single vote does not decide an election, the representation of our people should not be split in half, divided. The Electoral College does its best to give the nation the president it deserves."

Dear [State Senator's Name],

Hey there! I hope this letter finds you doing awesome. So, I've been thinking a lot about the whole Electoral College thing, you know, the fuss around it. People are debating whether we should keep it or ditch it in favor of a popular vote for the president. It's like, should we stick with the old-school or go for something new?

Honestly, after reading up on it, I'm leaning towards keeping the Electoral College. I get it; some folks are confused about how it works, but let me break it down. The Electoral College might seem a bit complex, but it's like the backbone of our voting system, ensuring we elect a president in a way that's fair and clear.

Now, some argue that our votes don't matter, but I beg to differ. We're running the show here; it's our government, right? Sure, we might not directly vote for the president, but our votes impact the decision. It's like this cool two-step dance – first, we vote for our candidate, and then we're backing up our candidate's electors. It's like having our own superhero squad, you know?

And get this – the Electoral College avoids the chaos that can come with a direct popular vote. Picture this: Nixon in '68 and Clinton in '92 had a lower percentage of popular votes, but they still nailed it with the Electoral College. This means we're more likely to get a clear winner, avoiding the mess that can come with close elections and campaigns.

Sure, it might seem simpler to just count the popular votes, but let's talk fairness. The Electoral College ensures a balance – it's not just about big states calling all the shots. Every state gets its say, and the "winnertakeall" system means a candidate winning a state gets all the electoral votes. It's like everyone gets their moment in the spotlight, you know?

I get there are counterarguments, like the tiebreaker thing and biases, but look, the Electoral College has been doing its job for ages. It's been tested, and yeah, it has flaws, but so does everything else. Plus, it encourages candidates to appeal to people all over the country, not just in a few hotspots.

So, there you have it – my take on why we should stick with the Electoral College. It might seem a bit confusing at first, but it's like the GPS for our democracy, guiding us to elect a president in a way that's fair, balanced, and ensures we all have a say.

Thanks a bunch for hearing me out. Can't wait to see what you think about it!

Cheers,

Write a letter to your state senator in which you argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Use the information from the texts in your essay. Manage your time carefully so that you can read the passages; plan your response; write your response; and revise and edit your response. Be sure to include a claim; address counterclaims; use evidence from multiple sources; and avoid overly relying on one source. Your response should be in the form of a multiparagraph essay. Write your response in the space provided. 

You are a US high school student. Use language fitting an average US teenager, imitating the structure and tone of the examples below. 

Example 1:
"There has been a fuss about the Elector College. Many people get confused about how it works and if they're satisfied with the whole process. Show we "abolish" the Elector College? Should we keep it? Honestly we should keep it. We the peope have more then enough control on who is chosen for the president of the United States Of America. We don't really vote for the president but our vote impacts the decision.

Many citizens of the United States Of America think their vote doesn matter, it does. Why? Well, first the government is runned by the people. Its very rare to not get the president that has the most popular votes, the last time when the president wasn't chosen was in 1888. It's less likely for the president with the most votes to lose the election. For example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the elector votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney. Plus, almost all states award elector votes on a winnertakeitall basis.

Perhaps, there was no system. Would it be simpler? Yes it would but we have to also be fair, there is 538 electors and a majority of 270 elector votes is required to elect the president. When you are voting for the president ypu want to win,you are actually voting for your canidate's elector. How does the system work? First it's the process that has the selection of the electors , the meeting of the electors where they vote for the president and vice president , and last but not least the counting of electoral votes by congress. Obviously it is kind of confusing because it would be much simpler if the winner would be the one with the most popular votes.

Did you know that the Elector College avoids the problem of elections? They do due to how much pressure the candidte can go through. It can easily complicate the presidential process. For instance, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Elector College 301 and 370 elector votes exactly. When avoiding the elections and campaigns , there a better chance of clear winner.

So there you have it,three main reason's why we should keep the Elector College. We have why the process is important and why we have it. How the process work's because it was confusing to many people , so it's defined and hopefully you'll like to stay and support the Elector College. Your vote does matter."

Example2:
"During my life i have watched many presidential elections on my television. To me the Electoral College on paper should work, Should being the key word. As I read the paragraphs on both why the Electoral College work and does not work I have decides the side with not having the Electoral College.

Historical evidence and evidence from this paragraph piont to not having a Electoral College. One reason for this was when Al Gore lost the presidency but won the popular vote nation wide as stated in Source 2. another piont is that if the people have so munch power over who is voted to be president then how do we have a president that the people did not want the president but the person is still elected, its an outrage! One example of how the Electoral College could be a disaster waiting to happen is that the votes are tied which may seem not likey at first glance but say if the votes are tied the presidency is thrown into the House of Representatives which lets face it, in the end the decision will not be approved by the people and the people will then barely have a say on who gets to be president or not. Another thing is the Electoral College can also be vary bisest towrdes one party or the other. This is evident because if a certain party got more electors than another party which whould led to a canedat from one party have more support then another.

Source 3 talks about how sure thats its possible for their to be a tie in the Electoral College but its unlikely supports what im trying the say in my earlier Paragraph, that even though a tie is unlikely it is still possible to happen the chance is still their. This paragraph also says the everyone is a president but if that is the case then why dose the poeple that "we" vote for the electoral College help vote for the president insted vote for the other canadate is an atrosidy on its own. The winnertakeall system is one that only afects the swing states because if thoughs states have already voted then the staes the already votes whould be for not because the numbers for who gets voted whould be already in favor of one state or another. The fact the larger states have a bigger say in who gets voted on is not fair. the is becuase if all the big states vote for someone and about 14 of the smaller states vote on one end of the scale and the other states vote towrdes the other end of the scale then the ballence whould be off and one side would overpower the other side by fact of shear numbers of votes compared to the other side.

After reading over my responce and the evidence that I have profided form the paragraph hear I have with great pride that i have argued my point across to you that the Electoral College in paper is good but in reality is only a crumbleing castle waiting to fall into the tiny bites and pieces that it should be."

Example 3:
"To who it may concern, With all the problems affiliated with the Electoral College, I believe that the United States should do away with the process. This process by which the president is elected is unfair to those of us who are old enough to vote and understand politics. Another disadvantage is that the system of Electoral College is very confusing to many people.

The worst thing about the Electoral College is that it is just outright puzzling. Men who are running for a spot as a presidential candidate are not voted for by the citizens of that state. They have to gain supporters who then become the electors. Then the people of that state have to vote for the electors, not the person to become a presidential candidate. Voters can't even directly vote for who they want. What if you vote for a slate of electors, who are supposed to be in favor of the presidential candidate you want, but don't vote for him?

"During the 2000 campaign seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all"Bradford Plumer, paragraph 13 Next time you go into that voting booth, remember that you're not voting for a president, you're voting and are supposed to trust an elector."

Example 5:
"The Electoral College has been established since the founding of our country. It is a system that has been tried and tested to work over the course of centuries. It should be upheld for it's ability to produce a solid outcome, and though it has the possibility of failing it's faults are not worse than the popular vote system, and that the Electoral College fosters a presidency campaign that appeals to multiple regions of the United States. This fair system allows representation of the people's will, just like the rest of our government does.

Faith in a certain outcome of the presidential election ensures that the vote has as little complications as possible, and is a reason the Electoral College is necessary. According to source one, "What Is The Electoral College?", each political party has it's own set of electors that equal the amount of congressional delegates per state. Usually each state has a "winnertakeall" method, so the presidential candidate that gets majority in your state will get all of the electors that represent their party, not just most of them. This is beneficial to the outcome of the election because it makes the ability for a candidate to get majority vote much simpler. There is less of a possibility of a tie, or an outcome where no candidate wins. Source 3, "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep out despised method of choosing president", states that "even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state..." , therefore allowing the candidate to secure all votes to their side, instead of having the votes divided on the line of majority rule, and causing rifts between Electoral College voters.

No system is perfect, and the Electoral College is not exempt from this. "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong", Source 2, argues that a term called disaster factor', or the possibility of imminent disaster due to the Electoral College system, is why the Electoral College system should be abolished. The passage uses individual instances, like the fact that in 1960, segrigationists in louisiana nearly appointed Democratic electors that would vote against their candidate, or that in rare instances, "faithless" electoral voters would vote for the other side. These are starman arguments, using specific instances to come to a conclusion that the whole system should be abolished. While the Electoral College system isn't perfect, neither is the popular vote system. The popular vote system has a higher chance of causing a tie between candidates, and it doesn't have a "winnertakeall" standard. In a tie, the vote would be given to the House of Representatives, which, according to source 2, "..can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people..", as citizens often vote one party in for president and another for Congress.

In addition, the Electoral College fosters a more nationwide appeal for the candidate's campaign. Source 3 brings up the fact that no region in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The "winnertakeall" system further benefits this, because in order to win, candidates have to focus their attention on states where their majority vote is insecure. They will not focus on regions where they have essentially secured the majority rule and therefore secured all the electoral votes. In popular vote, they would have to focus extensively on those regions, as the few that are not in the majority would need convincing. Source 3 goes into detail as to why a regionally picked candidate is not a proper show of the will of the people. It states that "The residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised to feel that thier votes do not count, that their new preident will have no regard for their interests...", and so having a transregional appeal is essential to properly representing the will of United States citizens.

Our Electoral College system should be defended and kept. It has the ability to produce a solid outcome, has flaws but ones that are not more disasterous than other systems, and drives candidates to try and present a national appeal. A single vote does not decide an election, the representation of our people should not be split in half, divided. The Electoral College does its best to give the nation the president it deserves."

Dear [Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. As a concerned and engaged high school student, I feel compelled to express my perspective on the ongoing debate regarding the Electoral College and its role in the election of the President of the United States. I have taken the time to consider various viewpoints on this matter and would like to present arguments in favor of maintaining the Electoral College system.

Firstly, one crucial aspect of the Electoral College that often goes unnoticed is its role in providing a clear and decisive outcome in presidential elections. The winner-takes-all approach adopted by most states ensures that the candidate with the most electoral votes secures victory. This not only simplifies the electoral process but also minimizes the likelihood of a tied election, avoiding the potential chaos and uncertainty associated with such scenarios.

Historically, the Electoral College has proven its effectiveness in preventing the election process from becoming overly complicated. For instance, the elections of Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both saw candidates with only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes securing a majority in the Electoral College with 301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively. This underscores the system's ability to avoid prolonged campaigns and potential disputes that may arise from close popular vote margins.

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes a fair and balanced representation of diverse interests across the nation. Candidates are compelled to appeal to a broad spectrum of regions rather than focusing solely on densely populated areas. This ensures that the concerns and needs of citizens from various states, regardless of size, are taken into account during the campaign. In contrast, a popular vote system could lead to candidates concentrating their efforts on a few populous regions, neglecting the interests of citizens in less densely populated areas.

While some argue that the popular vote would offer a more direct form of democracy, it is essential to recognize the potential flaws in such a system. The possibility of a tied vote or the need for a runoff election could introduce complications and undermine the stability that the Electoral College provides.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves as a critical component of our electoral process, offering a streamlined and effective method of electing the President. It ensures a clear outcome, avoids unnecessary complications, and fosters a more comprehensive representation of the nation's interests. I urge you to consider these points as you deliberate on this matter, and I trust that you will make decisions that uphold the integrity of our democratic system.

Thank you for your time and dedication to serving our great state.

Sincerely,

## You
Write a letter to your state senator in which you argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Use the information from the texts in your essay. Manage your time carefully so that you can read the passages; plan your response; write your response; and revise and edit your response. Be sure to include a claim; address counterclaims; use evidence from multiple sources; and avoid overly relying on one source. Your response should be in the form of a multiparagraph essay. Write your response in the space provided. 

You are a US high school student. Use language fitting imitating the structure and tone of the examples below. 

Example 1:
"There has been a fuss about the Elector College. Many people get confused about how it works and if they're satisfied with the whole process. Show we "abolish" the Elector College? Should we keep it? Honestly we should keep it. We the peope have more then enough control on who is chosen for the president of the United States Of America. We don't really vote for the president but our vote impacts the decision.

Many citizens of the United States Of America think their vote doesn matter, it does. Why? Well, first the government is runned by the people. Its very rare to not get the president that has the most popular votes, the last time when the president wasn't chosen was in 1888. It's less likely for the president with the most votes to lose the election. For example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the elector votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney. Plus, almost all states award elector votes on a winnertakeitall basis.

Perhaps, there was no system. Would it be simpler? Yes it would but we have to also be fair, there is 538 electors and a majority of 270 elector votes is required to elect the president. When you are voting for the president ypu want to win,you are actually voting for your canidate's elector. How does the system work? First it's the process that has the selection of the electors , the meeting of the electors where they vote for the president and vice president , and last but not least the counting of electoral votes by congress. Obviously it is kind of confusing because it would be much simpler if the winner would be the one with the most popular votes.

Did you know that the Elector College avoids the problem of elections? They do due to how much pressure the candidte can go through. It can easily complicate the presidential process. For instance, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Elector College 301 and 370 elector votes exactly. When avoiding the elections and campaigns , there a better chance of clear winner.

So there you have it,three main reason's why we should keep the Elector College. We have why the process is important and why we have it. How the process work's because it was confusing to many people , so it's defined and hopefully you'll like to stay and support the Elector College. Your vote does matter."

Example2:
"During my life i have watched many presidential elections on my television. To me the Electoral College on paper should work, Should being the key word. As I read the paragraphs on both why the Electoral College work and does not work I have decides the side with not having the Electoral College.

Historical evidence and evidence from this paragraph piont to not having a Electoral College. One reason for this was when Al Gore lost the presidency but won the popular vote nation wide as stated in Source 2. another piont is that if the people have so munch power over who is voted to be president then how do we have a president that the people did not want the president but the person is still elected, its an outrage! One example of how the Electoral College could be a disaster waiting to happen is that the votes are tied which may seem not likey at first glance but say if the votes are tied the presidency is thrown into the House of Representatives which lets face it, in the end the decision will not be approved by the people and the people will then barely have a say on who gets to be president or not. Another thing is the Electoral College can also be vary bisest towrdes one party or the other. This is evident because if a certain party got more electors than another party which whould led to a canedat from one party have more support then another.

Source 3 talks about how sure thats its possible for their to be a tie in the Electoral College but its unlikely supports what im trying the say in my earlier Paragraph, that even though a tie is unlikely it is still possible to happen the chance is still their. This paragraph also says the everyone is a president but if that is the case then why dose the poeple that "we" vote for the electoral College help vote for the president insted vote for the other canadate is an atrosidy on its own. The winnertakeall system is one that only afects the swing states because if thoughs states have already voted then the staes the already votes whould be for not because the numbers for who gets voted whould be already in favor of one state or another. The fact the larger states have a bigger say in who gets voted on is not fair. the is becuase if all the big states vote for someone and about 14 of the smaller states vote on one end of the scale and the other states vote towrdes the other end of the scale then the ballence whould be off and one side would overpower the other side by fact of shear numbers of votes compared to the other side.

After reading over my responce and the evidence that I have profided form the paragraph hear I have with great pride that i have argued my point across to you that the Electoral College in paper is good but in reality is only a crumbleing castle waiting to fall into the tiny bites and pieces that it should be."

Example 3:
"To who it may concern, With all the problems affiliated with the Electoral College, I believe that the United States should do away with the process. This process by which the president is elected is unfair to those of us who are old enough to vote and understand politics. Another disadvantage is that the system of Electoral College is very confusing to many people.

The worst thing about the Electoral College is that it is just outright puzzling. Men who are running for a spot as a presidential candidate are not voted for by the citizens of that state. They have to gain supporters who then become the electors. Then the people of that state have to vote for the electors, not the person to become a presidential candidate. Voters can't even directly vote for who they want. What if you vote for a slate of electors, who are supposed to be in favor of the presidential candidate you want, but don't vote for him? What happens then? presidential candidates who should actually get a chance at running for president because they didn't get enough electoral votes. This all leads to the next disadvantage of the Electoral College, unfairness.

As stated in an article by Bradford Plumer, "... Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency." The person running for president should be voted for directly by the voters. Someone, such as Al Gore, can get enough of the popular votes, but not enough of the electoral votes becuase they can't swing the votes in some states. This basically means that the majority of the United States would like to have Al Gore as a president, but couldn't because the majority of people in a state didn't want him as president.

To sum it up, the Electoral College should be eliminated from the presidential voting process. People should just directly vote for who they want as president and see where it goes from there."

Example 4:
"Senator, I believe that voting for the president of the United States should be based off of the popular vote by the people. Not the Electoral College. Voting by the Electoral College does not allow the people to have the final say. It ultimately gives the elector the choice. "The 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century" Bradford Plumer, paragraph 14, it was a disaster factor. The electors went against the will of the people and voted the opposite of what they said. Whose to say something like this can't happen again soon?

Some people say that the Electoral College is a good thing. It allows a certainty of outcome and is a fair, reasonable way to vote for a president. But it is based off of trust, that the elector won't betray the candidate's party and people. Trust. Are you really going to put your vote for the president of your country in someone else hand based off of trust?

Having an elector represent your state based off of population is ridiculous. One elector representing 500,000 people in Wyoming. Wouldn't you sleep better at night if you could represent yourself instead of someone representing you and thousands of other people all at once.

In 2000, a candidate had more popular votes, and less electoral votes and lost! Even though the people had more votes! How do you feel knowing that your vote doesn't even count? "Most states have a winnertakeall' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate"the Office of the Federal Register,paragraph 7. Because of this system, candidates will not spend time in certain states they know they have no chance in winning in. "During the 2000 campaign seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all"Bradford Plumer, paragraph 13 Next time you go into that voting booth, remember that you're not voting for a president, you're voting and are supposed to trust an elector."

They will not focus on regions where they have essentially secured the majority rule and therefore secured all the electoral votes. In popular vote, they would have to focus extensively on those regions, as the few that are not in the majority would need convincing. Source 3 goes into detail as to why a regionally picked candidate is not a proper show of the will of the people. It states that "The residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised to feel that thier votes do not count, that their new preident will have no regard for their interests...", and so having a transregional appeal is essential to properly representing the will of United States citizens.

Our Electoral College system should be defended and kept. It has the ability to produce a solid outcome, has flaws but ones that are not more disasterous than other systems, and drives candidates to try and present a national appeal. A single vote does not decide an election, the representation of our people should not be split in half, divided. The Electoral College does its best to give the nation the president it deserves."

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my viewpoint on the ongoing debate regarding the Electoral College and its role in electing the President of the United States. As a concerned high school student, I have carefully considered various perspectives, and I firmly believe that retaining the Electoral College is crucial for a fair and stable electoral process.

One key aspect supporting the Electoral College is its ability to provide a clear and decisive outcome in presidential elections. The winner-takes-all approach, followed by most states, ensures that the candidate with the majority of electoral votes secures victory. This not only simplifies the electoral process but also reduces the likelihood of tied elections, which could lead to confusion and potential disputes. The historical data mentioned in Example 1, such as Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, winning a majority in the Electoral College despite having only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, illustrates the system's effectiveness in avoiding prolonged campaigns and potential disputes arising from close popular vote margins.

Moreover, the Electoral College fosters a fair and balanced representation of diverse interests across the nation. Candidates are compelled to appeal to a broad spectrum of regions, ensuring that the concerns and needs of citizens from various states, regardless of size, are taken into account during the campaign. This regional representation prevents candidates from focusing solely on densely populated areas, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the nation's interests. The concerns raised in Example 5 about residents feeling disenfranchised in a purely popular vote system highlight the importance of the Electoral College in ensuring nationwide appeal and representation.

While some argue for a shift to a popular vote system, it is crucial to address potential flaws in such a change. A popular vote system might introduce complications, such as tied votes or the need for runoff elections, which could undermine the stability that the Electoral College provides. Additionally, the argument in Example 2 regarding the potential bias of the Electoral College towards one party or another is not unique to this system and could persist in a popular vote system as well.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system plays a vital role in ensuring a clear, stable, and representative outcome in presidential elections. It simplifies the process, avoids unnecessary complications, and encourages candidates to consider the interests of a diverse nation. I urge you to consider these points as you deliberate on this important issue, and I trust that you will make decisions that uphold the integrity of our democratic system.

Thank you for your time and dedication to serving our great state.

Sincerely,

Write a letter to your state senator in which you argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Use the information from the texts in your essay. Manage your time carefully so that you can read the passages; plan your response; write your response; and revise and edit your response. Be sure to include a claim; address counterclaims; use evidence from multiple sources; and avoid overly relying on one source. Your response should be in the form of a multiparagraph essay. Write your response in the space provided. 

You are a US high school student. Use language fitting imitating the structure and tone of the examples below. 

Example 1:
"electoral College would be better than the popular votes and I will be telling you about how in the next few paragraphs. Technically speaking electoral college is a popular vote, but in a different way. We vote for the electors. So that would mean the majority of the population have to still vote. Wouldn't you rather have a well thought out person than some one that isn't that smart or well thought out. Some one that could make a better decision for you.

Voters can still vote just not for the president. You would be voting for the electors who will then elect the president. Voting for a certain elector you could still be voting for the president you want. The popular votes can be tied together, many of the votes before were so close to being tied, and that would be a wreck. Could you imagine what would happen to the people. They would go crazy. Just because it hasn't happened yet doesn't mean it won't ever happen. Having an electoral college could cause some dispute, but not as much as the popular vote has already caused. So many arguments and with an electoral college not many would have to deal with those disputes.

The electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have a transregional appeal. So that means no one president can win because of a regional favorite. I mean who would want a president that would most likely favor a certain region because they voted for him. They would feel like he wasn't even their president or they had no say in votes. A president with only regional appeal would most likely not be a good president.

The electoral college makes sure that the electors will pay close attention to the campaign knowing that they decide the election. So the electors will be more thoughtful than some people in the popular vote. The electors can make a better decisions than most of us can. They would be able to make the decisions better and listen to the candidates more than we ever could.

Yes in some ways the popular vote can be good, but think of all the people that make the wrong decisions. The ones that would just vote for how the candidate looks. Not the thoughts and campaigns he brings. So in many more ways the Electoral college is better than the popular vote."

Example 2:
"Dear state senator , i strongly believe in keeping the electoral college to be in care of the way the elections would proceed instead of changing the outcome of elections to popular vote because voters may not believe in what the candidate's intentions for the people but may like the candidate, it is more organized , and the people would be pleased with the outcome.

The electoral college is a great way of proceeding with elections because changing the way our election system is to one of popularity voting would not be wise because voters may not believe in what the candidate's intentions are for the people but they may like the candidate. There is more of a certainty when the electoral college is in charge for example when Obama was running against rodney he only received 61.7% of the electoral vote compared to the 51.3% percent of the popular votes that have been casted for both him and rodney but because of the majority percentage of electoral votes that were casted in his favor.

The electoral college is more organized than a popular vote because if a voter has voted for example Obama for the electoral vote but voted for rodney for the popular vote it would be unorganized because of the split vote between popular and electoral which is recquired the majority of when in a public govermental election which could impact the whole future for the nation. The election for Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 they both had only a 43 percentage plurality of popular votes while also winning a majority in the electoral college which was 301 and 370 electoral votes. When no candidate fully wins the majority of the votes that were casted they wouldn't have to recount the votes of have a reelection which would drain the economies money because of the high amount of money put into one election in the first place just to have another election, whereas the electoral college can just step in and rectify the situation just by producing a clear winner on their own instead of going through a long process just to find out who the clear winner is all they have to do is debate among themselves who they believe the people would be happy with in the long run.

Electoral college is the best way because in the long run the people would be pleased with the outcome that they have voted for because if it was turned into a popular vote election people who voted for a specific president wouldn't have won just because they aren't popular amongst the people that are voters iin that year's election. However the popular vote election may also be a good idea because if the voters cast a vote for you in the popular election that should essentially like your intentions that would benefit the countries needs and demands that are recquired for us in the long run.

Therefore the electoral college should stay in charge of all decsions having to do with the elections for new presidencey when the time time comes because if it was changed to popular vote people would vote for the candidate that they like the best instead of the candidate with the best intentions for the nation, it is considerably more organized than a popular vote election , and the people would be end up being pleased with the outcome in the long run."

Example 3:
"Dear Florida Senator, I am here to tell you about thee electoral collage, and not why we should keep thee horrible theing, but how we can replace it withe sometheing better. The electoral collage has been in use for a very long time, since thee Constitution was finalized, but it should end now. The Electoral Collage is a confusing system theat can easily be manipulated and changed to benefit one political party. As shown in many past elections, it has just become anotheer reason people do not want to vote. Popular vote is easy and simple and it should be used in future elections.

First of all confusion is a huge factor when talking about thee Electoral collage. We as voters do not want all theese processes. We do not want hoops theat we want to jump therough. We are simple people who want a simple process. In thee electoral collage, theere are 538 electors, withe a majority of 270 needed to be voted in as president. Each state gets entitled to two for your senators, and one for each member of thee House of Representatives. This so far is making my head spin. This could be so much simpler if we just used thee poular voting system. In theis system, thee people can directly vote for theier president witheout any huge hassel. This makes it easier and more fair for thee voters. Speaking of fair, lets talk about how Unfair thee Electoral Collage is.

In thee Electoral Collage, theere is no partial winning. It is a winner take all system, withe thee exception of Maine and Nebraska. This makes it very unfair to votes. Swing states add on to theis idea. Swing states are very large states theat have a higher representation in thee Electoral collage. These are also thee main targets of presidential candidates. By getting theese swing states, candidates can gain a lot of votes in one state. This leaves otheer states, such as Ohio and Montana withe little to no interaction from thee presidential candidates. This is not fair. We need thee popular vote system. We need to be able to equally represent everyone witheout any shady practices. And theat is thee last topic, thee electors really control thee final outcome.

The final sin of thee electoral collage is just too big to look over. The electoral collage can change wetheer a person is voted in or not because of thee electors. They choose who theey represent. If you can not see where theis is going let me explain. A set of people who want a specific president can just represent him. This could go so far as to leave a state withe only representatives of one candidate. This could never happen in popular vote because we don't have electors, we have people. We have real American people who want to vote for who theey want to vote for. Notheing more, notheing less.

Even theough thee Electoral Collage seems like the root of all evil, theere are a few upsides. First, theere is less likely to have a dispute thean a popular vote. A dispute is not impossible, it is just less likely. Second, big states are weighted how theey should be. They are larger states theat comprise most of thee population and thee country. They should be represented more thean smaller states. Finally, since it is a winner takes all, theere are no RunOff elections. This keeps thee process shorter, but not as short as it would be in thee popular vote system.

So to conclude, popular vote should be used in upcomming elections. The electoral collage is a confusing system theat can easily be manipulated to help or hurt a specific candidate. Altheough thee electoral collage properly represent smaller states and avoids RunOff elections, it does not represent smaller states and can easly shift thee election from one side to anotheer. Popular vote keeps thee process short and makes it fair. It represents everyone fairly. I do not want you to agree withe me, I want you to look and thee cold hard facts. Popular vote should be used in thee Election from now on."

While some argue for a shift to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College, despite its imperfections, offers several advantages, including providing a clear and decisive outcome, maintaining regional balance, and ensuring a more thoughtful decision-making process.

One of the key strengths of the Electoral College is its ability to produce a clear and decisive outcome in presidential elections. The winner-takes-all approach adopted by most states simplifies the process, reducing the likelihood of tied votes and potential disputes. This has been demonstrated throughout history, as seen in examples like Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, who secured a majority in the Electoral College despite having only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes. This clarity in outcomes helps prevent prolonged campaigns and ensures a smooth transition of power.

Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages candidates to have a transregional appeal, preventing the election of a president based solely on regional popularity. This regional balance ensures that candidates must address the concerns of citizens from various states, regardless of their size. As mentioned in Example 5, a president with only regional appeal may not be representative of the entire nation's interests, leading to disenfranchisement among citizens in other regions. The Electoral College, by requiring candidates to consider a broader audience, promotes a more inclusive and representative democracy.

Additionally, the Electoral College fosters a more thoughtful decision-making process among electors. These electors, representing the will of the people in their respective states, play a crucial role in the final outcome. As highlighted in Example 1, the electors pay close attention to the campaign, knowing that they hold the responsibility of deciding the election. This thoughtful consideration by electors stands in contrast to concerns raised about the potential for voters in a popular vote system to make decisions based on superficial factors rather than the candidates' policies and campaigns.

While the popular vote system may seem appealing, it is essential to address potential flaws, such as tied votes, the need for runoff elections, and the risk of candidates focusing solely on densely populated areas. The Electoral College, despite its imperfections, provides a balance that ensures fair representation and prevents the dominance of a few populous regions over the entire nation.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, with its ability to provide a clear outcome, maintain regional balance, and foster thoughtful decision-making, remains a crucial component of the democratic process. I urge you to consider these points as you deliberate on this matter, and I trust that you will make decisions that prioritize the stability and fairness of our electoral system.

This is not fair. We need thee popular vote system. We need to be able to equally represent everyone witheout any shady practices. And theat is thee last topic, thee electors really control thee final outcome.

The final sin of thee electoral collage is just too big to look over. The electoral collage can change wetheer a person is voted in or not because of thee electors. They choose who theey represent. If you can not see where theis is going let me explain. A set of people who want a specific president can just represent him. This could go so far as to leave a state withe only representatives of one candidate. This could never happen in popular vote because we don't have electors, we have people. We have real American people who want to vote for who theey want to vote for. Notheing more, notheing less.

Even theough thee Electoral Collage seems like the root of all evil, theere are a few upsides. First, theere is less likely to have a dispute thean a popular vote. A dispute is not impossible, it is just less likely. Second, big states are weighted how theey should be. They are larger states theat comprise most of thee population and thee country. They should be represented more thean smaller states. Finally, since it is a winner takes all, theere are no RunOff elections. This keeps thee process shorter, but not as short as it would be in thee popular vote system.

So to conclude, popular vote should be used in upcomming elections. The electoral collage is a confusing system theat can easily be manipulated to help or hurt a specific candidate. Altheough thee electoral collage properly represent smaller states and avoids RunOff elections, it does not represent smaller states and can easly shift thee election from one side to anotheer. Popular vote keeps thee process short and makes it fair. It represents everyone fairly. I do not want you to agree withe me, I want you to look and thee cold hard facts. Popular vote should be used in thee Election from now on."

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to you as a concerned high school student who strongly believes that maintaining the Electoral College is essential for the fair and effective election of the President of the United States. While there are arguments in favor of transitioning to a popular vote system, it is crucial to consider the Electoral College's advantages, such as providing a decisive outcome, maintaining regional balance, and ensuring a more thoughtful decision-making process.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a clear and decisive outcome in presidential elections. This winner-takes-all approach, as highlighted in Example 1, reduces the likelihood of tied votes and potential disputes, offering stability to the democratic process. This certainty contributes to a smooth transition of power and minimizes the risk of prolonged election disputes, which could be detrimental to the nation's well-being.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes regional balance by requiring presidential candidates to have transregional appeal, as stated in Example 1. This prevents a situation where a president might be elected solely based on regional popularity, ensuring that the elected leader represents the interests of the entire nation. Without this requirement, candidates might focus solely on densely populated areas, neglecting the concerns of citizens in less populous regions.

Moreover, the Electoral College fosters a more thoughtful decision-making process, as outlined in Example 1. Electors play a crucial role in the final outcome and are expected to carefully consider the candidates and their campaigns. This thoughtful consideration by electors stands in contrast to concerns about voters in a popular vote system making decisions based on superficial factors rather than the candidates' policies and campaigns.

While the popular vote system has its merits, it is essential to address potential flaws, such as the risk of tied votes, the need for runoff elections, and the concentration of candidate focus on highly populated areas. The Electoral College, despite its imperfections, provides a balance that ensures fair representation and prevents the dominance of a few populous regions over the entire nation.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, with its ability to provide a clear outcome, maintain regional balance, and foster thoughtful decision-making, remains a crucial component of the democratic process. I urge you to consider these points as you deliberate on this matter, keeping in mind the stability and fairness of our electoral system. Thank you for your time and dedication to serving our great state.

## You
Write a letter to your state senator in which you argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Use the information from the texts in your essay. Manage your time carefully so that you can read the passages; plan your response; write your response; and revise and edit your response. Be sure to include a claim; address counterclaims; use evidence from multiple sources; and avoid overly relying on one source. Your response should be in the form of a multiparagraph essay. Write your response in the space provided. 

You are a US high school student. Use language fitting an average US teenager, imitating the structure and tone of the examples below. 

Example 1:
"There has been a fuss about the Elector College. Many people get confused about how it works and if they're satisfied with the whole process. Show we "abolish" the Elector College? Should we keep it? Honestly we should keep it. We the peope have more then enough control on who is chosen for the president of the United States Of America. We don't really vote for the president but our vote impacts the decision.

Many citizens of the United States Of America think their vote doesn matter, it does. Why? Well, first the government is runned by the people. Its very rare to not get the president that has the most popular votes, the last time when the president wasn't chosen was in 1888. It's less likely for the president with the most votes to lose the election. For example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the elector votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney. Plus, almost all states award elector votes on a winnertakeitall basis.

Perhaps, there was no system. Would it be simpler? Yes it would but we have to also be fair, there is 538 electors and a majority of 270 elector votes is required to elect the president. When you are voting for the president ypu want to win,you are actually voting for your canidate's elector. How does the system work? First it's the process that has the selection of the electors , the meeting of the electors where they vote for the president and vice president , and last but not least the counting of electoral votes by congress. Obviously it is kind of confusing because it would be much simpler if the winner would be the one with the most popular votes.

Did you know that the Elector College avoids the problem of elections? They do due to how much pressure the candidte can go through. It can easily complicate the presidential process. For instance, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Elector College 301 and 370 elector votes exactly. When avoiding the elections and campaigns , there a better chance of clear winner.

So there you have it,three main reason's why we should keep the Elector College. We have why the process is important and why we have it. How the process work's because it was confusing to many people , so it's defined and hopefully you'll like to stay and support the Elector College. Your vote does matter."

Example2:
"During my life i have watched many presidential elections on my television. To me the Electoral College on paper should work, Should being the key word. As I read the paragraphs on both why the Electoral College work and does not work I have decides the side with not having the Electoral College.

Historical evidence and evidence from this paragraph piont to not having a Electoral College. One reason for this was when Al Gore lost the presidency but won the popular vote nation wide as stated in Source 2. another piont is that if the people have so munch power over who is voted to be president then how do we have a president that the people did not want the president but the person is still elected, its an outrage! One example of how the Electoral College could be a disaster waiting to happen is that the votes are tied which may seem not likey at first glance but say if the votes are tied the presidency is thrown into the House of Representatives which lets face it, in the end the decision will not be approved by the people and the people will then barely have a say on who gets to be president or not. Another thing is the Electoral College can also be vary bisest towrdes one party or the other. This is evident because if a certain party got more electors than another party which whould led to a canedat from one party have more support then another.

Source 3 talks about how sure thats its possible for their to be a tie in the Electoral College but its unlikely supports what im trying the say in my earlier Paragraph, that even though a tie is unlikely it is still possible to happen the chance is still their. This paragraph also says the everyone is a president but if that is the case then why dose the poeple that "we" vote for the electoral College help vote for the president insted vote for the other canadate is an atrosidy on its own. The winnertakeall system is one that only afects the swing states because if thoughs states have already voted then the staes the already votes whould be for not because the numbers for who gets voted whould be already in favor of one state or another. The fact the larger states have a bigger say in who gets voted on is not fair. the is becuase if all the big states vote for someone and about 14 of the smaller states vote on one end of the scale and the other states vote towrdes the other end of the scale then the ballence whould be off and one side would overpower the other side by fact of shear numbers of votes compared to the other side.

After reading over my responce and the evidence that I have profided form the paragraph hear I have with great pride that i have argued my point across to you that the Electoral College in paper is good but in reality is only a crumbleing castle waiting to fall into the tiny bites and pieces that it should be."

Example 3:
"To who it may concern, With all the problems affiliated with the Electoral College, I believe that the United States should do away with the process. This process by which the president is elected is unfair to those of us who are old enough to vote and understand politics. Another disadvantage is that the system of Electoral College is very confusing to many people.

The worst thing about the Electoral College is that it is just outright puzzling. Men who are running for a spot as a presidential candidate are not voted for by the citizens of that state. They have to gain supporters who then become the electors. Then the people of that state have to vote for the electors, not the person to become a presidential candidate. Voters can't even directly vote for who they want. What if you vote for a slate of electors, who are supposed to be in favor of the presidential candidate you want, but don't vote for him? What happens then? presidential candidates who should actually get a chance at running for president because they didn't get enough electoral votes. This all leads to the next disadvantage of the Electoral College, unfairness.

As stated in an article by Bradford Plumer, "... Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency." The person running for president should be voted for directly by the voters. Someone, such as Al Gore, can get enough of the popular votes, but not enough of the electoral votes becuase they can't swing the votes in some states. This basically means that the majority of the United States would like to have Al Gore as a president, but couldn't because the majority of people in a state didn't want him as president.

To sum it up, the Electoral College should be eliminated from the presidential voting process. People should just directly vote for who they want as president and see where it goes from there."

Example 4:
"Senator, I believe that voting for the president of the United States should be based off of the popular vote by the people. Not the Electoral College. Voting by the Electoral College does not allow the people to have the final say. It ultimately gives the elector the choice. "The 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century" Bradford Plumer, paragraph 14, it was a disaster factor. The electors went against the will of the people and voted the opposite of what they said. Whose to say something like this can't happen again soon?

Some people say that the Electoral College is a good thing. It allows a certainty of outcome and is a fair, reasonable way to vote for a president. But it is based off of trust, that the elector won't betray the candidate's party and people. Trust. Are you really going to put your vote for the president of your country in someone else hand based off of trust?

Having an elector represent your state based off of population is ridiculous. One elector representing 500,000 people in Wyoming. Wouldn't you sleep better at night if you could represent yourself instead of someone representing you and thousands of other people all at once.

In 2000, a candidate had more popular votes, and less electoral votes and lost! Even though the people had more votes! How do you feel knowing that your vote doesn't even count? "Most states have a winnertakeall' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate"the Office of the Federal Register,paragraph 7. Because of this system, candidates will not spend time in certain states they know they have no chance in winning in. "During the 2000 campaign seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all"Bradford Plumer, paragraph 13 Next time you go into that voting booth, remember that you're not voting for a president, you're voting and are supposed to trust an elector."

Example 5:
"The Electoral College has been established since the founding of our country. It is a system that has been tried and tested to work over the course of centuries. It should be upheld for it's ability to produce a solid outcome, and though it has the possibility of failing it's faults are not worse than the popular vote system, and that the Electoral College fosters a presidency campaign that appeals to multiple regions of the United States. This fair system allows representation of the people's will, just like the rest of our government does.

Faith in a certain outcome of the presidential election ensures that the vote has as little complications as possible, and is a reason the Electoral College is necessary. According to source one, "What Is The Electoral College?", each political party has it's own set of electors that equal the amount of congressional delegates per state. Usually each state has a "winnertakeall" method, so the presidential candidate that gets majority in your state will get all of the electors that represent their party, not just most of them. This is beneficial to the outcome of the election because it makes the ability for a candidate to get majority vote much simpler. There is less of a possibility of a tie, or an outcome where no candidate wins. Source 3, "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep out despised method of choosing president", states that "even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state..." , therefore allowing the candidate to secure all votes to their side, instead of having the votes divided on the line of majority rule, and causing rifts between Electoral College voters.

No system is perfect, and the Electoral College is not exempt from this. "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong", Source 2, argues that a term called disaster factor', or the possibility of imminent disaster due to the Electoral College system, is why the Electoral College system should be abolished. The passage uses individual instances, like the fact that in 1960, segrigationists in louisiana nearly appointed Democratic electors that would vote against their candidate, or that in rare instances, "faithless" electoral voters would vote for the other side. These are starman arguments, using specific instances to come to a conclusion that the whole system should be abolished. While the Electoral College system isn't perfect, neither is the popular vote system. The popular vote system has a higher chance of causing a tie between candidates, and it doesn't have a "winnertakeall" standard. In a tie, the vote would be given to the House of Representatives, which, according to source 2, "..can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people..", as citizens often vote one party in for president and another for Congress.

In addition, the Electoral College fosters a more nationwide appeal for the candidate's campaign. Source 3 brings up the fact that no region in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The "winnertakeall" system further benefits this, because in order to win, candidates have to focus their attention on states where their majority vote is insecure. They will not focus on regions where they have essentially secured the majority rule and therefore secured all the electoral votes. In popular vote, they would have to focus extensively on those regions, as the few that are not in the majority would need convincing. Source 3 goes into detail as to why a regionally picked candidate is not a proper show of the will of the people. It states that "The residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised to feel that thier votes do not count, that their new preident will have no regard for their interests...", and so having a transregional appeal is essential to properly representing the will of United States citizens.

Our Electoral College system should be defended and kept. It has the ability to produce a solid outcome, has flaws but ones that are not more disasterous than other systems, and drives candidates to try and present a national appeal. A single vote does not decide an election, the representation of our people should not be split in half, divided. The Electoral College does its best to give the nation the president it deserves."

Dear [Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my support for the continuation of the Electoral College in the United States presidential elections. While there is ongoing debate about whether to keep this system or switch to a popular vote, I firmly believe that the Electoral College serves as a vital component of our democratic process.

One primary advantage of the Electoral College is its ability to provide a clear and decisive outcome, as discussed in Example 1. The winner-takes-all approach ensures that a candidate who secures the majority of electoral votes is declared the president. This method reduces the likelihood of tied votes and prevents the need for runoff elections, which could be time-consuming and costly for the nation. The certainty of outcome offered by the Electoral College contributes to the stability and efficiency of the presidential election process.

Another crucial aspect of the Electoral College is its role in maintaining regional balance, as highlighted in Example 1. By requiring presidential candidates to have transregional appeal, the Electoral College prevents candidates from focusing solely on densely populated areas. This ensures that the elected president represents the interests of the entire nation, fostering unity and preventing the dominance of a few populous regions over the rest of the country.

Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages a more thoughtful decision-making process, as outlined in Example 1. Electors play a significant role in the final outcome and are expected to carefully consider the candidates and their campaigns.

The Electoral College, despite its imperfections, provides a balance that ensures fair representation and prevents the dominance of specific regions over the entire nation.

In conclusion, I urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College in our presidential elections. Its ability to provide a clear outcome, maintain regional balance, and foster thoughtful decision-making makes it a crucial component of our democratic process. Thank you for your time and consideration of this matter.

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this message reaches you well. As a high school student concerned about the current discussions surrounding the Electoral College, I feel compelled to express my support for maintaining this system in the presidential elections.

The Electoral College, though often criticized, serves a crucial role in our democratic process. Contrary to the sentiments of those advocating for its abolition, the Electoral College ensures that the president is chosen with consideration for the entire nation rather than being decided solely by densely populated areas. This point is well illustrated by the fact that candidates must have transregional appeal to secure victory, preventing them from concentrating only on populous regions, as mentioned in Example 1.

One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College is its ability to provide a clear and decisive outcome, as highlighted in the first example. The winner-takes-all approach minimizes the risk of tied votes and prevents the need for runoff elections, which could be both time-consuming and financially burdensome for the country. This certainty of outcome contributes to the stability and efficiency of the presidential election process.

Moreover, the Electoral College encourages a more thoughtful and strategic approach to campaigning, as discussed in Example 1. Candidates are required to appeal to a diverse range of states, considering both the large and small, urban and rural, thereby preventing the dominance of a few highly populated regions over the entire nation. This fosters a fair representation of the interests and concerns of citizens from various parts of the country.

While some argue for the popular vote system, it is crucial to address the potential flaws and drawbacks associated with it. For instance, the possibility of tied votes, the lack of a winner-takes-all standard, and the concentration of candidate focus on densely populated areas are challenges that could undermine the fairness and representativeness of the election process.

In conclusion, I urge you to consider the advantages of the Electoral College in ensuring a fair and balanced representation of the nation's interests in presidential elections. While it may have imperfections, it stands as a vital element of our democratic process that requires careful consideration before any decisions are made. Thank you for your time and dedication to serving our community.

## You
Write a letter to your state senator in which you argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Use the information from the texts in your essay. Manage your time carefully so that you can read the passages; plan your response; write your response; and revise and edit your response. Be sure to include a claim; address counterclaims; use evidence from multiple sources; and avoid overly relying on one source. Your response should be in the form of a multiparagraph essay. Write your response in the space provided. 

You are a US high school student. Use language fitting an average US teenager, imitating the structure and tone of the examples below. 

Example 1:
"There has been a fuss about the Elector College. Many people get confused about how it works and if they're satisfied with the whole process. Show we "abolish" the Elector College? Should we keep it? Honestly we should keep it. We the peope have more then enough control on who is chosen for the president of the United States Of America. We don't really vote for the president but our vote impacts the decision.

Many citizens of the United States Of America think their vote doesn matter, it does. Why? Well, first the government is runned by the people. Its very rare to not get the president that has the most popular votes, the last time when the president wasn't chosen was in 1888. It's less likely for the president with the most votes to lose the election. For example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the elector votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney. Plus, almost all states award elector votes on a winnertakeitall basis.

Perhaps, there was no system. Would it be simpler? Yes it would but we have to also be fair, there is 538 electors and a majority of 270 elector votes is required to elect the president. When you are voting for the president ypu want to win,you are actually voting for your canidate's elector. How does the system work? First it's the process that has the selection of the electors , the meeting of the electors where they vote for the president and vice president , and last but not least the counting of electoral votes by congress. Obviously it is kind of confusing because it would be much simpler if the winner would be the one with the most popular votes.

Did you know that the Elector College avoids the problem of elections? They do due to how much pressure the candidte can go through. It can easily complicate the presidential process. For instance, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Elector College 301 and 370 elector votes exactly. When avoiding the elections and campaigns , there a better chance of clear winner.

So there you have it,three main reason's why we should keep the Elector College. We have why the process is important and why we have it. How the process work's because it was confusing to many people , so it's defined and hopefully you'll like to stay and support the Elector College. Your vote does matter."

Example2:
"During my life i have watched many presidential elections on my television. To me the Electoral College on paper should work, Should being the key word. As I read the paragraphs on both why the Electoral College work and does not work I have decides the side with not having the Electoral College.

Historical evidence and evidence from this paragraph piont to not having a Electoral College. One reason for this was when Al Gore lost the presidency but won the popular vote nation wide as stated in Source 2. another piont is that if the people have so munch power over who is voted to be president then how do we have a president that the people did not want the president but the person is still elected, its an outrage! One example of how the Electoral College could be a disaster waiting to happen is that the votes are tied which may seem not likey at first glance but say if the votes are tied the presidency is thrown into the House of Representatives which lets face it, in the end the decision will not be approved by the people and the people will then barely have a say on who gets to be president or not. Another thing is the Electoral College can also be vary bisest towrdes one party or the other. This is evident because if a certain party got more electors than another party which whould led to a canedat from one party have more support then another.

Source 3 talks about how sure thats its possible for their to be a tie in the Electoral College but its unlikely supports what im trying the say in my earlier Paragraph, that even though a tie is unlikely it is still possible to happen the chance is still their. This paragraph also says the everyone is a president but if that is the case then why dose the poeple that "we" vote for the electoral College help vote for the president insted vote for the other canadate is an atrosidy on its own. The winnertakeall system is one that only afects the swing states because if thoughs states have already voted then the staes the already votes whould be for not because the numbers for who gets voted whould be already in favor of one state or another. The fact the larger states have a bigger say in who gets voted on is not fair. the is becuase if all the big states vote for someone and about 14 of the smaller states vote on one end of the scale and the other states vote towrdes the other end of the scale then the ballence whould be off and one side would overpower the other side by fact of shear numbers of votes compared to the other side.

After reading over my responce and the evidence that I have profided form the paragraph hear I have with great pride that i have argued my point across to you that the Electoral College in paper is good but in reality is only a crumbleing castle waiting to fall into the tiny bites and pieces that it should be."

Example 3:
"To who it may concern, With all the problems affiliated with the Electoral College, I believe that the United States should do away with the process. This process by which the president is elected is unfair to those of us who are old enough to vote and understand politics. Another disadvantage is that the system of Electoral College is very confusing to many people.

The worst thing about the Electoral College is that it is just outright puzzling. Men who are running for a spot as a presidential candidate are not voted for by the citizens of that state. They have to gain supporters who then become the electors. Then the people of that state have to vote for the electors, not the person to become a presidential candidate. Voters can't even directly vote for who they want. What if you vote for a slate of electors, who are supposed to be in favor of the presidential candidate you want, but don't vote for him? What happens then? presidential candidates who should actually get a chance at running for president because they didn't get enough electoral votes. This all leads to the next disadvantage of the Electoral College, unfairness.

As stated in an article by Bradford Plumer, "... Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency." The person running for president should be voted for directly by the voters. Someone, such as Al Gore, can get enough of the popular votes, but not enough of the electoral votes becuase they can't swing the votes in some states. This basically means that the majority of the United States would like to have Al Gore as a president, but couldn't because the majority of people in a state didn't want him as president.

To sum it up, the Electoral College should be eliminated from the presidential voting process. People should just directly vote for who they want as president and see where it goes from there."

Example 4:
"Senator, I believe that voting for the president of the United States should be based off of the popular vote by the people. Not the Electoral College. Voting by the Electoral College does not allow the people to have the final say. It ultimately gives the elector the choice. "The 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century" Bradford Plumer, paragraph 14, it was a disaster factor. The electors went against the will of the people and voted the opposite of what they said. Whose to say something like this can't happen again soon?

Some people say that the Electoral College is a good thing. It allows a certainty of outcome and is a fair, reasonable way to vote for a president. But it is based off of trust, that the elector won't betray the candidate's party and people. Trust. Are you really going to put your vote for the president of your country in someone else hand based off of trust?

Having an elector represent your state based off of population is ridiculous. One elector representing 500,000 people in Wyoming. Wouldn't you sleep better at night if you could represent yourself instead of someone representing you and thousands of other people all at once.

In 2000, a candidate had more popular votes, and less electoral votes and lost! Even though the people had more votes! How do you feel knowing that your vote doesn't even count? "Most states have a winnertakeall' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate"the Office of the Federal Register,paragraph 7. Because of this system, candidates will not spend time in certain states they know they have no chance in winning in. "During the 2000 campaign seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all"Bradford Plumer, paragraph 13 Next time you go into that voting booth, remember that you're not voting for a president, you're voting and are supposed to trust an elector."

Example 5:
"The Electoral College has been established since the founding of our country. It is a system that has been tried and tested to work over the course of centuries. It should be upheld for it's ability to produce a solid outcome, and though it has the possibility of failing it's faults are not worse than the popular vote system, and that the Electoral College fosters a presidency campaign that appeals to multiple regions of the United States. This fair system allows representation of the people's will, just like the rest of our government does.

Faith in a certain outcome of the presidential election ensures that the vote has as little complications as possible, and is a reason the Electoral College is necessary. According to source one, "What Is The Electoral College?", each political party has it's own set of electors that equal the amount of congressional delegates per state. Usually each state has a "winnertakeall" method, so the presidential candidate that gets majority in your state will get all of the electors that represent their party, not just most of them. This is beneficial to the outcome of the election because it makes the ability for a candidate to get majority vote much simpler. There is less of a possibility of a tie, or an outcome where no candidate wins. Source 3, "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep out despised method of choosing president", states that "even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state..." , therefore allowing the candidate to secure all votes to their side, instead of having the votes divided on the line of majority rule, and causing rifts between Electoral College voters.

No system is perfect, and the Electoral College is not exempt from this. "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong", Source 2, argues that a term called disaster factor', or the possibility of imminent disaster due to the Electoral College system, is why the Electoral College system should be abolished. The passage uses individual instances, like the fact that in 1960, segrigationists in louisiana nearly appointed Democratic electors that would vote against their candidate, or that in rare instances, "faithless" electoral voters would vote for the other side. These are starman arguments, using specific instances to come to a conclusion that the whole system should be abolished. While the Electoral College system isn't perfect, neither is the popular vote system. The popular vote system has a higher chance of causing a tie between candidates, and it doesn't have a "winnertakeall" standard. In a tie, the vote would be given to the House of Representatives, which, according to source 2, "..can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people..", as citizens often vote one party in for president and another for Congress.

In addition, the Electoral College fosters a more nationwide appeal for the candidate's campaign. Source 3 brings up the fact that no region in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The "winnertakeall" system further benefits this, because in order to win, candidates have to focus their attention on states where their majority vote is insecure. They will not focus on regions where they have essentially secured the majority rule and therefore secured all the electoral votes. In popular vote, they would have to focus extensively on those regions, as the few that are not in the majority would need convincing. Source 3 goes into detail as to why a regionally picked candidate is not a proper show of the will of the people. It states that "The residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised to feel that thier votes do not count, that their new preident will have no regard for their interests...", and so having a transregional appeal is essential to properly representing the will of United States citizens.

Our Electoral College system should be defended and kept. It has the ability to produce a solid outcome, has flaws but ones that are not more disasterous than other systems, and drives candidates to try and present a national appeal. A single vote does not decide an election, the representation of our people should not be split in half, divided. The Electoral College does its best to give the nation the president it deserves."

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. As a high school student closely following the discussions on the future of the Electoral College, I am writing to express my support for retaining this system in the presidential elections or, at the very least, maintaining a thoughtful and careful approach to any potential changes.

In the ongoing debate about the Electoral College, it is crucial to recognize the advantages it offers in terms of ensuring a fair and balanced representation of the entire nation. While some argue for the popular vote system, the Electoral College prevents candidates from concentrating solely on densely populated areas and necessitates transregional appeal for victory. This is highlighted in Example 1, where it is mentioned that the system encourages a more nationwide focus, preventing the dominance of a few highly populated regions over the entire nation.

One of the key strengths of the Electoral College is its ability to provide a clear and decisive outcome. The winner-takes-all approach minimizes the risk of tied votes and ensures that a candidate securing a majority in a state gets all the electors representing that state. This simplicity in outcome, as mentioned in Example 5, contributes to the stability and efficiency of the presidential election process, preventing the need for lengthy runoff elections that could be both time-consuming and costly for the country.

Furthermore, the Electoral College addresses concerns about potential biases in favor of one party or another. Example 2 points out that the system prevents the presidency from being decided solely by the majority in larger states, thereby maintaining a balance that prevents the overpowering of one side by sheer numbers. This ensures that candidates need to appeal to a diverse range of states, large and small, urban and rural, for a chance at victory.

While no system is perfect, the potential flaws associated with the Electoral College, such as the "disaster factor" mentioned in Example 5, should be weighed against the flaws of alternative systems. The popular vote system, as discussed in the same example, has a higher chance of causing ties between candidates and lacks the winner-takes-all standard, potentially leading to more complications and uncertainties in the election process.

In conclusion, I urge you to consider the advantages of the Electoral College in maintaining a fair and balanced representation of the nation's interests in presidential elections. Any potential changes to the system should be approached with caution, ensuring that the proposed alternatives do not introduce new challenges or biases. I appreciate your time and dedication to serving our community, and I trust that you will carefully consider the perspectives of young constituents like me.

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. As a high school student keenly interested in the current debates surrounding the Electoral College, I wanted to express my strong support for maintaining this system in our presidential elections. While there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe the Electoral College provides a fair and effective method of electing the president, ensuring that diverse voices from all regions of our country are heard.

One of the key reasons for supporting the Electoral College, as highlighted in Example 1, is its role in preventing the concentration of power in densely populated areas. In a nation as vast and diverse as ours, it is essential that presidential candidates appeal to a wide range of states and regions. The winner-takes-all approach ensures that candidates must consider the interests and concerns of citizens from various backgrounds, fostering a more comprehensive and inclusive campaign.

Moreover, the Electoral College has proven to be a stable and efficient system over the course of history. As mentioned in Example 5, the system's ability to provide a clear and decisive outcome minimizes the risk of tied votes and ensures that the elected president has a majority support in the Electoral College. This simplicity in outcome contributes to the stability of our election process, preventing prolonged and uncertain scenarios that could arise with other voting systems.

While some argue for a direct popular vote, it is crucial to consider the potential drawbacks of such a system. As pointed out in Example 2, a popular vote system could lead to issues like tied votes, potentially throwing the election into the House of Representatives, where the decision may not accurately reflect the will of the people. The winner-takes-all system in the Electoral College, as discussed in Example 5, minimizes this risk by providing a clear majority for one candidate in each state.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign nationwide, as opposed to focusing solely on highly populated regions. This transregional appeal, emphasized in Example 5, ensures that candidates address the concerns of citizens from various states, promoting a more balanced and representative approach to governance. In contrast, a popular vote system might incentivize candidates to concentrate their efforts in densely populated urban areas, potentially overlooking the needs of citizens in less populous regions.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College remains a vital component of our democratic process. It promotes fairness, stability, and ensures that the president represents the diverse interests of our entire nation. While improvements can always be considered, it is essential to approach any changes with caution, taking into account the potential consequences and drawbacks of alternative systems.

Thank you for your time and consideration of my perspective. I trust that you will carefully weigh the arguments presented by your constituents and make decisions that best serve the interests of our great nation.

# Keep Electoral College

## You
Write a letter to your state senator in which you argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Use the information from the texts in your essay. Manage your time carefully so that you can read the passages; plan your response; write your response; and revise and edit your response. Be sure to include a claim; address counterclaims; use evidence from multiple sources; and avoid overly relying on one source. Your response should be in the form of a multiparagraph essay. Write your response in the space provided. 

You are a US high school student. Use language fitting an average US teenager, imitating the structure and tone of the examples below. 

Example 1:
"When the Constitution of the United States was written our founding fathers decided on an Electoral College as the way to elect the president instead of a direct vote. The Electoral College is a process that makes a compromise between the popular vote of the citizens and the Congressional vote. When citizens vote for president they are actually voting for a member of the Electoral College that is going to select their president, rather than the citizens voting for the president themselves. The Electoral College is made of 538 electors, the number of electors from each state varies depending on the states Congressional delegation. Washington D.C. is counted as a state for this process and alloted only three electors. The electoral college should be kept in use because it simplifies the outcome and allocates more power to the larger states.

The Electoral College should continue being used in today's government as a form of selecting the president because it simplifies the outcome of the vote. When voting with a popular vote system a debate over the outcome of the vote is very likely and will probably cause some controversy. When the votes form the electoral college are counted the margin of victory is much higher which simplifies the result of the poll. During the election of 2012 Obama only recieved 51.3 percent of the vote, however he won the vote of the electoral college with an astounding 61.7 percent, a increase in the margin of victory by 10.4 percent. With this wide of a margin of victory a dispute over the victor of the presidential election is unlikely and almost impossible to argue against. Some might argue that the Electoral College is flawed because electors can choose not to vote for their candidate. It is true that this has happened in the past, "in 1960, segregationist in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded on replacing the Democratc electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy." P.11. If this happened the popular vote for Kennedy would have gone to his adversaries instead. It is true that electors can choose not to vote for the candidate they pledged to and that this has happened in the past however the electors rarely betray their party's nominee and a tie in the electoral vote is extremely unlikely.

Additionally, the Electoral College sould be kept in today's democracy because is allocates power to the larger states. It only makes sense that the larger states with a larger population should get more of a say in their government, and recieve more electoral votes than a small state with fewer people. With this system political influence is restored to the larger states making the candidates focuss on the more populous areas. More power to the more populous states also means that runoff elections are avoided. In 1992 and in 1968 runoff elections were avoided due to the use of the Electoral College "Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority of the Electoral College" P.22. A runoff election extremely complicates the election process however the chance of this happening is greatly reduced when using the Electoral College which almost always produces a clear winner.

The electoral college should be kept in use because it simplifies the outcome and allocates more power to the larger states. The Electoral College avoids the outcome of a runoff election. It also greatly reduces the chance of a dispute between the victor. Most people do not like the Electoral College because they are not directly voting for their candidate however many people fail to realize hat it is rare for an elector to betray his nominee. Electors rarely betray their candidate because they are chosen by the candidates party or the candidate themself. The Electoral College gives political weight to states and is very useful in deciding the new president with no debates over who won."

Example 2:
"Americans around the world gather around their televisions, frantically waiting to see who the next leader of the USA is. The first Tuesday of November is always an exciting time for American citizens. Citizens watch the number of votes go up, thinking their vote counted, when in reality, it did not. Many people are aware of the electoral college. The electoral college are the ones truly voting for the United States leader. While we may have had this process for years, it's time for us to take a vote to change the way we vote. Citizens of the United States of America should be able to vote by popular vote because the electoral college is outdated and ruins the American freedom.

The world we live in now compared to the 1800s is very different. We've upgraded, not only in our inventions, but our states as well. The electoral college was made when America was first established because it was fit for the needs of that time. The Office of Federal Register states, "The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens." Back then, it was needed to balance things out among the 13 colonies. In those times, we didn't have the advance technology we have now to see our candidates on screens or in person. Since then, we've turned 13 colonies into 50 states, turned horses into cars, and small radios into televisions. Rules and laws change to fit the current needs all the time. The electoral college should do the same. Due to the fact this system has been around since the founding fathers, major mistakes occur. This process is too old to keep up with the third largest population in the world. Bradford Plumer of source 2 tells us that in 2000 "Al Gorethanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency." If this is truly a land of democracy and of the people, how could we let such a mistake happen? How could we let majority of citizens vote but not get the person they choose?

Another factor to this problem is the American freedom. The electoral college imposes on the American freedom and right to choose their president. The United States of America is a representative democracy. The citizens choose who they want to lead but those votes aren't truly their own votes. According to Richard A. Posner of source 3, "...the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidental candidate, you're actually voting for a slate of electors." American citizen votes do not matter as much as we think they should. The founding fathers built this country for the people. The people should have an actual voice in who they want to lead this great nation. In addition, Americans should have a direct say. Votes should go straight to the president and not the party's electors. This is not only fair to citizens but also a more relible plan. Bradford Plumer of source 2 explains to us that ""faithless" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..." We can't depend on these electors to determine one of the most important things of this country. We can't depend on these "faithless" electors to vote who we want when they might do the opposite. Voting by popular vote prevents these mishaps and restores our democracy.

While others may claim that the electoral college is beneficial to candidates because of big states, small states, and swing states, it's a onesided deal. It may be beneficial to candidates but what about the voters? Source 2 reads "during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad." If these candidates expect to lead the third largest country population wise, they should have to put out the extra effort to visit and campaign to every state. The candidates need to show they care for this country and they are here for everyone. If they cannot put in the extra effort to see the lives they are going to change, do they deserve to be president?

All in all, the electoral college is no longer needed to today. The electoral college is made for the modern world and also disrupts our representative democracy. Times are always changing, we, as a society, are always changing, and the electoral college needs to change as well."

Example 3:
"Dear Mr. President, As Americans, we are told that we are given rights in our country. We have the freedom of speech, expression, religion, and petition as stated in our first amendment. We are also told the we have the freedom to vote once you reach certain requirements, like age and citizenship. However, are we really getting the freedom that is talked about? No. Because the Electoral College is present in today's society, our vote becomes pointless and meaningless. We become a "popular" vote, but really the electoral college gets to decide who becomes presidents. The Electoral College has been in our Constitution since the Constitution was approved, but we have modified simple things as in gender discrimination and race discrimination, why are we not going to change this unjust system?

Bradford Plumer, author of The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the Bestlaid Defenses of System are Wrong, explains how the electoral college is fooling our citizens to think we have a say in our country's government. He elaborates further to say that "Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. This proves my point further, because once again we do not vote for our president, we vote for the people who get the "privilege" to vote for the most prestine place of power in our entire country.

The next problem with our Electoral College is that each state is given an uneven amount of representatives form each state. If Florida voted candidate A, but North Dakota voted for candidate B, candidate A is bound to win because Florida has twentynine representatives and North Dakota only has three. As you can see Mr. President, this becomes a preblem because four states with only three representatives could vote for one candidate, but if Florida votes for the other one, the first candidate has already lost.

Now most people are afraid of change, which is understandable. They are afraid chaos will occur if any change with our society's ethics. However, the Electoral College has already caused chaos between the two opposing sides. If we tried a new system, we could see if the people will become more civilized because they now have a say in the government. If it doesn't work, then we can always change it back and no harm will be done. As you can see, there are many possibilities and options we have yet to explore.

Mr. President, I have explained to you what the people want, which is to stop being lied to. However, every four years comes around, and yet I do not see a change in anything. I do not think it is only the people who are afraid of change, it is also you. But, would you want to live in a world where everyone hates the way the government works or a world where the citizens are given the rights they were promised? Mr. President it is now up to you to do the right thing."

Example 4:
"Dear Mr. rubin, My name is PROPER_NAME and I am a concerned youth.

The electoral college system is arcane, confusing and disruptive to the constitutional democratic republic that is the United States of America. Voters are thrown off by this system and are often completely overlooked in an election. For a country that was built on the ideals of freedom and fair representation, using the electoral college system isn't right.

Firstly, candidates running for president need a majority of 270 the 538 electors to win an election. Thus, they focus more on winning swing states such as Ohio, rather than winning the approval of their constituents. This immediately shows faults of the electoral college. What kind of government is running the world's superpower? One that ignores its people and bombs governments of other countries for doing the same thing? The electoral college takes away from the value of the vote a right for which the United States of America was founded. The electoral college may have had good and just intentions, but isn't effective or fair now. Also, with the embarrassingly low voter turnout the USA has already, having a confusing, oldfashioned and unfair system of electing leaders will only decrease the amount of citizens that actually go to the polls. Studies like the one published September 1st, 2012 by the American Research Institute, have shown that the average American person doesn't know very much about their country and how it works. Those that do are a minority. So, why would the government that is supposed to be looking out for, protecting and listening to its citizens still use a system that only deters already ignorant people from participating in elections?

Secondly, the electoral college in addition to putting down the voter has been proven to be faulty. Like the 2000 election with George W. Bush, with Clinton in 1992 and Nixon in 1968 these men all had less of the popular vote, but were president. How? How did they become the Leader of the Free World the Free World that gives everyone the right to vote for their representatives without the popular vote? Without the blessing of their constituents? How were these men sworn in without the backing of true democracy?

The electoral college.

This system goes against every democratic ideal in the United states foundation! And yet, it is still how president after president is put into the Oval Office sometimes wrongly as explained above.

The electoral college is wrong. It just is. There are no valid arguments for it. It puts down the voter and, in a sense, makes them obsolete which, in addition to being extremely hypocritical, is just not right.

Mr. rubin, I am a citizen of this great country. I don't break the law, I don't burn flags, I love my nation and I care deeply for my fellow Americans. You are a United States Senator. Shouldn't you feel the same way? Help to abolish the electoral college. There are only benefits for the corrupt, not for the citizens.

Mr. rubin, help to abolish the electoral college if you believe in a strong America."

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. As a concerned citizen and a high school student, I wanted to share my thoughts on the Electoral College system used to elect the President of the United States.

The Electoral College, established by our founding fathers, has been a crucial part of our electoral process. It serves as a compromise between a direct popular vote and congressional selection. One of the key reasons I believe the Electoral College should be maintained is because it simplifies the outcome of the election. In a popular vote system, disputes over the results are more likely, leading to potential controversies and debates. The Electoral College, with its clear allocation of electors, provides a more straightforward and decisive outcome.

For instance, during the 2012 election, President Obama received 51.3 percent of the popular vote but secured a decisive victory in the Electoral College with 61.7 percent. This significant margin of victory demonstrates how the Electoral College can prevent disputes and promote a clear winner.

While some argue that the Electoral College is flawed because electors can choose not to vote for their pledged candidate, historical instances of such events are rare. As mentioned in a source, the attempt to replace Democratic electors in 1960 was unsuccessful, emphasizing the overall loyalty of electors to their party's nominee.

Furthermore, the Electoral College allocates power proportionally to the population of each state, giving larger states more influence. This makes sense, as states with larger populations should have a greater say in shaping the nation's leadership. It ensures that candidates pay attention to the more populous areas and reduces the likelihood of runoff elections, as demonstrated by the avoidance of runoff elections in 1992 and 1968.

In conclusion, the Electoral College simplifies election outcomes and provides a fair allocation of power among states. It has proven effective in preventing disputes and promoting clear winners. While concerns about faithless electors exist, these instances are rare, and the overall benefits of the Electoral College outweigh the potential drawbacks.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I believe that maintaining the Electoral College is in the best interest of our democracy.

Sincerely,

You are a US high school student. Use language fitting an average US teenager, imitating the structure and tone of the examples below. 

Example 1:
"When the Constitution of the United States was written our founding fathers decided on an Electoral College as the way to elect the president instead of a direct vote. The Electoral College is a process that makes a compromise between the popular vote of the citizens and the Congressional vote. When citizens vote for president they are actually voting for a member of the Electoral College that is going to select their president, rather than the citizens voting for the president themselves. The Electoral College is made of 538 electors, the number of electors from each state varies depending on the states Congressional delegation. Washington D.C. is counted as a state for this process and alloted only three electors. The electoral college should be kept in use because it simplifies the outcome and allocates more power to the larger states.

The Electoral College should continue being used in today's government as a form of selecting the president because it simplifies the outcome of the vote. When voting with a popular vote system a debate over the outcome of the vote is very likely and will probably cause some controversy. When the votes form the electoral college are counted the margin of victory is much higher which simplifies the result of the poll. During the election of 2012 Obama only recieved 51.3 percent of the vote, however he won the vote of the electoral college with an astounding 61.7 percent, a increase in the margin of victory by 10.4 percent.

Dear [State Senator's Name],

Hey there! Hope you're doing well. So, I wanted to hit you up about something that's been on my mind – the whole deal with the Electoral College. Now, I get it's been around since the founding fathers were rocking their wigs, but let's talk about why it's still cool or maybe not so cool.

First off, the Electoral College is like this middleman in our presidential elections. We vote, but it's the Electors who actually decide who's gonna be the big boss. Some folks say it's a chill system because it avoids messy disputes and gives more power to the big states. You know, it's like saying, "Hey, California, Texas, New York, you guys have more people, so you get more say in who's running the show." Makes sense, right?

Take the 2012 election – Obama got 51.3% of the popular vote, but in the Electoral College, he scored a massive 61.7%. That's like winning big at a video game. And let's be real, if we went with a popular vote, we could be stuck in debates, arguments, and who knows what. It's like when the squad can't decide on a movie – imagine that but for the leader of the free world. Yikes!

Now, yeah, some people throw shade at the Electoral College because Electors can go rogue and vote against their pledge. In 1960, there was almost a plot twist where Electors wanted to switch sides. Drama! But honestly, it's rare, like finding a unicorn rare. So, it's not that big a deal.

Plus, it's all about giving the bigger states some love. We don't want candidates just hanging out in the popular cities and ignoring everyone else. Think about it – without the Electoral College, some states might never get a visit from a candidate, and that's not cool. Like, Rhode Island and South Carolina got zero attention during the 2000 campaign. Not cool, right?

Now, I get some peeps are all about changing things up. They're saying the Electoral College is like the grandpa of election systems, and it's time for an upgrade. They're not feeling the vibe of a system where some Electors could go all "faithless" on us. But you know what? Change isn't always a slam dunk.

So, that's my take on the Electoral College – it's like our voting superhero, keeping things simple, avoiding showdowns, and making sure every state gets some love. But hey, I'm just a high schooler trying to make sense of it all.

Thanks for listening, and if you've got thoughts on this, hit me back!

In 1992 and in 1968 runoff elections were avoided due to the use of the Electoral College "Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority of the Electoral College" P.22. A runoff election extremely complicates the election process however the chance of this happening is greatly reduced when using the Electoral College which almost always produces a clear winner.

The electoral college should be kept in use because it simplifies the outcome and allocates more power to the larger states. The Electoral College avoids the outcome of a runoff election. It also greatly reduces the chance of a dispute between the victor. Most people do not like the Electoral College because they are not directly voting for their candidate however many people fail to realize hat it is rare for an elector to betray his nominee. Electors rarely betray their candidate because they are chosen by the candidates party or the candidate themself. The Electoral College gives political weight to states and is very useful in deciding the new president with no debates over who won."

Example 2:
"Americans around the world gather around their televisions, frantically waiting to see who the next leader of the USA is. The first Tuesday of November is always an exciting time for American citizens. Citizens watch the number of votes go up, thinking their vote counted, when in reality, it did not. Many people are aware of the electoral college. The electoral college are the ones truly voting for the United States leader. While we may have had this process for years, it's time for us to take a vote to change the way we vote. Citizens of the United States of America should be able to vote by popular vote because the electoral college is outdated and ruins the American freedom.

The world we live in now compared to the 1800s is very different. We've upgraded, not only in our inventions, but our states as well. The electoral college was made when America was first established because it was fit for the needs of that time. The Office of Federal Register states, "The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens." Back then, it was needed to balance things out among the 13 colonies. In those times, we didn't have the advance technology we have now to see our candidates on screens or in person. Since then, we've turned 13 colonies into 50 states, turned horses into cars, and small radios into televisions. Rules and laws change to fit the current needs all the time. The electoral college should do the same. Due to the fact this system has been around since the founding fathers, major mistakes occur. This process is too old to keep up with the third largest population in the world. Bradford Plumer of source 2 tells us that in 2000 "Al Gorethanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency." If this is truly a land of democracy and of the people, how could we let such a mistake happen? How could we let majority of citizens vote but not get the person they choose?

Another factor to this problem is the American freedom. The electoral college imposes on the American freedom and right to choose their president. The United States of America is a representative democracy. The citizens choose who they want to lead but those votes aren't truly their own votes. According to Richard A. Posner of source 3, "...the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidental candidate, you're actually voting for a slate of electors." American citizen votes do not matter as much as we think they should. The founding fathers built this country for the people. The people should have an actual voice in who they want to lead this great nation. In addition, Americans should have a direct say. Votes should go straight to the president and not the party's electors. This is not only fair to citizens but also a more relible plan. Bradford Plumer of source 2 explains to us that ""faithless" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..." We can't depend on these electors to determine one of the most important things of this country. We can't depend on these "faithless" electors to vote who we want when they might do the opposite. Voting by popular vote prevents these mishaps and restores our democracy.

While others may claim that the electoral college is beneficial to candidates because of big states, small states, and swing states, it's a onesided deal. It may be beneficial to candidates but what about the voters? Source 2 reads "during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad." If these candidates expect to lead the third largest country population wise, they should have to put out the extra effort to visit and campaign to every state. The candidates need to show they care for this country and they are here for everyone. If they cannot put in the extra effort to see the lives they are going to change, do they deserve to be president?

All in all, the electoral college is no longer needed to today. The electoral college is made for the modern world and also disrupts our representative democracy. Times are always changing, we, as a society, are always changing, and the electoral college needs to change as well."

Example 3:
"Dear Mr. President, As Americans, we are told that we are given rights in our country. We have the freedom of speech, expression, religion, and petition as stated in our first amendment. We are also told the we have the freedom to vote once you reach certain requirements, like age and citizenship. However, are we really getting the freedom that is talked about? No. Because the Electoral College is present in today's society, our vote becomes pointless and meaningless. We become a "popular" vote, but really the electoral college gets to decide who becomes presidents. The Electoral College has been in our Constitution since the Constitution was approved, but we have modified simple things as in gender discrimination and race discrimination, why are we not going to change this unjust system?

Bradford Plumer, author of The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the Bestlaid Defenses of System are Wrong, explains how the electoral college is fooling our citizens to think we have a say in our country's government. He elaborates further to say that "Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. This proves my point further, because once again we do not vote for our president, we vote for the people who get the "privilege" to vote for the most prestine place of power in our entire country.

The next problem with our Electoral College is that each state is given an uneven amount of representatives form each state. If Florida voted candidate A, but North Dakota voted for candidate B, candidate A is bound to win because Florida has twentynine representatives and North Dakota only has three. As you can see Mr. President, this becomes a preblem because four states with only three representatives could vote for one candidate, but if Florida votes for the other one, the first candidate has already lost.

Now most people are afraid of change, which is understandable. They are afraid chaos will occur if any change with our society's ethics. However, the Electoral College has already caused chaos between the two opposing sides. If we tried a new system, we could see if the people will become more civilized because they now have a say in the government. If it doesn't work, then we can always change it back and no harm will be done. As you can see, there are many possibilities and options we have yet to explore.

Mr. President, I have explained to you what the people want, which is to stop being lied to. However, every four years comes around, and yet I do not see a change in anything. I do not think it is only the people who are afraid of change, it is also you. But, would you want to live in a world where everyone hates the way the government works or a world where the citizens are given the rights they were promised? Mr. President it is now up to you to do the right thing."

Example 4:
"Dear Mr. rubin, My name is PROPER_NAME and I am a concerned youth.

The electoral college system is arcane, confusing and disruptive to the constitutional democratic republic that is the United States of America. Voters are thrown off by this system and are often completely overlooked in an election. For a country that was built on the ideals of freedom and fair representation, using the electoral college system isn't right.

Firstly, candidates running for president need a majority of 270 the 538 electors to win an election. Thus, they focus more on winning swing states such as Ohio, rather than winning the approval of their constituents. This immediately shows faults of the electoral college. What kind of government is running the world's superpower? One that ignores its people and bombs governments of other countries for doing the same thing? The electoral college takes away from the value of the vote a right for which the United States of America was founded. The electoral college may have had good and just intentions, but isn't effective or fair now. Also, with the embarrassingly low voter turnout the USA has already, having a confusing, oldfashioned and unfair system of electing leaders will only decrease the amount of citizens that actually go to the polls. Studies like the one published September 1st, 2012 by the American Research Institute, have shown that the average American person doesn't know very much about their country and how it works. Those that do are a minority. So, why would the government that is supposed to be looking out for, protecting and listening to its citizens still use a system that only deters already ignorant people from participating in elections?

Secondly, the electoral college in addition to putting down the voter has been proven to be faulty. Like the 2000 election with George W. Bush, with Clinton in 1992 and Nixon in 1968 these men all had less of the popular vote, but were president. How? How did they become the Leader of the Free World the Free World that gives everyone the right to vote for their representatives without the popular vote? Without the blessing of their constituents? How were these men sworn in without the backing of true democracy?

The electoral college.

This system goes against every democratic ideal in the United states foundation! And yet, it is still how president after president is put into the Oval Office sometimes wrongly as explained above.

The electoral college is wrong. It just is. There are no valid arguments for it. It puts down the voter and, in a sense, makes them obsolete which, in addition to being extremely hypocritical, is just not right.

Mr. rubin, I am a citizen of this great country. I don't break the law, I don't burn flags, I love my nation and I care deeply for my fellow Americans. You are a United States Senator. Shouldn't you feel the same way? Help to abolish the electoral college. There are only benefits for the corrupt, not for the citizens.

Mr. rubin, help to abolish the electoral college if you believe in a strong America."

Dear [State Senator's Name],

Yo, what's up? Hope you're good. I wanted to drop you a note about this whole Electoral College situation. So, check it – some people are all about ditching it, but I've been thinking, and I reckon we should keep it or at least think twice before shaking things up.

Back when the Constitution was cooked up, our founding folks decided the Electoral College was the way to roll instead of a straight-up popular vote. It's like this middle ground between what the people want and what Congress wants. See, when we vote, we're actually choosing Electors who pick the president. It's like a double vote – kinda wild, right? And we've got 538 of these Electors, with each state getting a different number based on their crew in Congress. Even D.C. gets a piece of the action with three Electors.

Now, why stick with this Electoral College vibe? Well, for starters, it keeps things simple. Imagine if we went full popular vote – we'd be knee-deep in debates, drama, and probably some serious confusion. Like, in 2012, Obama snagged 51.3% of the popular vote, but when we checked the Electoral College score, it was a jaw-dropping 61.7%. Talk about a clear winner! No messy disputes there.

Sure, there's this buzz about Electors going rogue, like in 1960 when Louisiana almost pulled a fast one on Kennedy. But let's be real, those moments are rarer than a snow day in July. Electors usually stick with their party's pick, and ties in the Electoral College? Crazy unlikely.

And here's the real deal – the Electoral College throws some love to the big states. I mean, it makes sense, right? More people, more say. It's like a VIP pass for the larger states, and it keeps candidates from just hanging out in the popular cities. Plus, it avoids those messy runoff elections – remember 1992 and 1968? No one wants that chaos.

So, bottom line – the Electoral College keeps things straightforward, ditches the drama, and gives the big states the political muscle they deserve. Sure, it's not perfect, but what system is? And ditching it might lead to even more problems, you feel?

Thanks for reading, and if you've got thoughts, hit me back!

Write a letter to your state senator in which you argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Use the information from the texts in your essay. Manage your time carefully so that you can read the passages; plan your response; write your response; and revise and edit your response. Be sure to include a claim; address counterclaims; use evidence from multiple sources; and avoid overly relying on one source. Your response should be in the form of a multiparagraph essay. Write your response in the space provided. 

You are a US high school student. Use language fitting an average US teenager, imitating the structure and tone of the examples below. 

Example 1:
"When the Constitution of the United States was written our founding fathers decided on an Electoral College as the way to elect the president instead of a direct vote. The Electoral College is a process that makes a compromise between the popular vote of the citizens and the Congressional vote. When citizens vote for president they are actually voting for a member of the Electoral College that is going to select their president, rather than the citizens voting for the president themselves. The Electoral College is made of 538 electors, the number of electors from each state varies depending on the states Congressional delegation. Washington D.C. is counted as a state for this process and alloted only three electors. The electoral college should be kept in use because it simplifies the outcome and allocates more power to the larger states.

The Electoral College should continue being used in today's government as a form of selecting the president because it simplifies the outcome of the vote. When voting with a popular vote system a debate over the outcome of the vote is very likely and will probably cause some controversy. When the votes form the electoral college are counted the margin of victory is much higher which simplifies the result of the poll. During the election of 2012 Obama only recieved 51.3 percent of the vote, however he won the vote of the electoral college with an astounding 61.7 percent, a increase in the margin of victory by 10.4 percent. With this wide of a margin of victory a dispute over the victor of the presidential election is unlikely and almost impossible to argue against. Some might argue that the Electoral College is flawed because electors can choose not to vote for their candidate. It is true that this has happened in the past, "in 1960, segregationist in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded on replacing the Democratc electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy." P.11. If this happened the popular vote for Kennedy would have gone to his adversaries instead. It is true that electors can choose not to vote for the candidate they pledged to and that this has happened in the past however the electors rarely betray their party's nominee and a tie in the electoral vote is extremely unlikely.

Additionally, the Electoral College sould be kept in today's democracy because is allocates power to the larger states. It only makes sense that the larger states with a larger population should get more of a say in their government, and recieve more electoral votes than a small state with fewer people. With this system political influence is restored to the larger states making the candidates focuss on the more populous areas. More power to the more populous states also means that runoff elections are avoided. In 1992 and in 1968 runoff elections were avoided due to the use of the Electoral College "Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority of the Electoral College" P.22.

While we may have had this process for years, it's time for us to take a vote to change the way we vote. Citizens of the United States of America should be able to vote by popular vote because the electoral college is outdated and ruins the American freedom.

The world we live in now compared to the 1800s is very different. We've upgraded, not only in our inventions, but our states as well. The electoral college was made when America was first established because it was fit for the needs of that time. The Office of Federal Register states, "The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens." Back then, it was needed to balance things out among the 13 colonies. In those times, we didn't have the advance technology we have now to see our candidates on screens or in person. Since then, we've turned 13 colonies into 50 states, turned horses into cars, and small radios into televisions. Rules and laws change to fit the current needs all the time. The electoral college should do the same. Due to the fact this system has been around since the founding fathers, major mistakes occur. This process is too old to keep up with the third largest population in the world. Bradford Plumer of source 2 tells us that in 2000 "Al Gorethanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency." If this is truly a land of democracy and of the people, how could we let such a mistake happen? How could we let majority of citizens vote but not get the person they choose?

Another factor to this problem is the American freedom. The electoral college imposes on the American freedom and right to choose their president. The United States of America is a representative democracy. The citizens choose who they want to lead but those votes aren't truly their own votes. According to Richard A. Posner of source 3, "...the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidental candidate, you're actually voting for a slate of electors." American citizen votes do not matter as much as we think they should. The founding fathers built this country for the people. The people should have an actual voice in who they want to lead this great nation. In addition, Americans should have a direct say. Votes should go straight to the president and not the party's electors. This is not only fair to citizens but also a more relible plan. Bradford Plumer of source 2 explains to us that ""faithless" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..." We can't depend on these electors to determine one of the most important things of this country. We can't depend on these "faithless" electors to vote who we want when they might do the opposite. Voting by popular vote prevents these mishaps and restores our democracy.

While others may claim that the electoral college is beneficial to candidates because of big states, small states, and swing states, it's a onesided deal. It may be beneficial to candidates but what about the voters? Source 2 reads "during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad." If these candidates expect to lead the third largest country population wise, they should have to put out the extra effort to visit and campaign to every state. The candidates need to show they care for this country and they are here for everyone. If they cannot put in the extra effort to see the lives they are going to change, do they deserve to be president?

All in all, the electoral college is no longer needed to today. The electoral college is made for the modern world and also disrupts our representative democracy. Times are always changing, we, as a society, are always changing, and the electoral college needs to change as well."

Example 3:
"Dear Mr. President, As Americans, we are told that we are given rights in our country. We have the freedom of speech, expression, religion, and petition as stated in our first amendment. We are also told the we have the freedom to vote once you reach certain requirements, like age and citizenship. However, are we really getting the freedom that is talked about? No. Because the Electoral College is present in today's society, our vote becomes pointless and meaningless. We become a "popular" vote, but really the electoral college gets to decide who becomes presidents. The Electoral College has been in our Constitution since the Constitution was approved, but we have modified simple things as in gender discrimination and race discrimination, why are we not going to change this unjust system?

Bradford Plumer, author of The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the Bestlaid Defenses of System are Wrong, explains how the electoral college is fooling our citizens to think we have a say in our country's government. He elaborates further to say that "Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. This proves my point further, because once again we do not vote for our president, we vote for the people who get the "privilege" to vote for the most prestine place of power in our entire country.

The next problem with our Electoral College is that each state is given an uneven amount of representatives form each state. If Florida voted candidate A, but North Dakota voted for candidate B, candidate A is bound to win because Florida has twentynine representatives and North Dakota only has three. As you can see Mr. President, this becomes a preblem because four states with only three representatives could vote for one candidate, but if Florida votes for the other one, the first candidate has already lost.

Now most people are afraid of change, which is understandable. They are afraid chaos will occur if any change with our society's ethics. However, the Electoral College has already caused chaos between the two opposing sides. If we tried a new system, we could see if the people will become more civilized because they now have a say in the government. If it doesn't work, then we can always change it back and no harm will be done. As you can see, there are many possibilities and options we have yet to explore.

Mr. President, I have explained to you what the people want, which is to stop being lied to. However, every four years comes around, and yet I do not see a change in anything. I do not think it is only the people who are afraid of change, it is also you. But, would you want to live in a world where everyone hates the way the government works or a world where the citizens are given the rights they were promised? Mr. President it is now up to you to do the right thing."

Example 4:
"Dear Mr. rubin, My name is PROPER_NAME and I am a concerned youth.

The electoral college system is arcane, confusing and disruptive to the constitutional democratic republic that is the United States of America. Voters are thrown off by this system and are often completely overlooked in an election. For a country that was built on the ideals of freedom and fair representation, using the electoral college system isn't right.

Firstly, candidates running for president need a majority of 270 the 538 electors to win an election. Thus, they focus more on winning swing states such as Ohio, rather than winning the approval of their constituents. This immediately shows faults of the electoral college. What kind of government is running the world's superpower? One that ignores its people and bombs governments of other countries for doing the same thing? The electoral college takes away from the value of the vote a right for which the United States of America was founded. The electoral college may have had good and just intentions, but isn't effective or fair now. Also, with the embarrassingly low voter turnout the USA has already, having a confusing, oldfashioned and unfair system of electing leaders will only decrease the amount of citizens that actually go to the polls. Studies like the one published September 1st, 2012 by the American Research Institute, have shown that the average American person doesn't know very much about their country and how it works. Those that do are a minority. So, why would the government that is supposed to be looking out for, protecting and listening to its citizens still use a system that only deters already ignorant people from participating in elections?

Secondly, the electoral college in addition to putting down the voter has been proven to be faulty. Like the 2000 election with George W. Bush, with Clinton in 1992 and Nixon in 1968 these men all had less of the popular vote, but were president. How? How did they become the Leader of the Free World the Free World that gives everyone the right to vote for their representatives without the popular vote? Without the blessing of their constituents? How were these men sworn in without the backing of true democracy?

The electoral college.

This system goes against every democratic ideal in the United states foundation! And yet, it is still how president after president is put into the Oval Office sometimes wrongly as explained above.

The electoral college is wrong. It just is. There are no valid arguments for it. It puts down the voter and, in a sense, makes them obsolete which, in addition to being extremely hypocritical, is just not right.

Mr. rubin, I am a citizen of this great country. I don't break the law, I don't burn flags, I love my nation and I care deeply for my fellow Americans. You are a United States Senator. Shouldn't you feel the same way? Help to abolish the electoral college. There are only benefits for the corrupt, not for the citizens.

Mr. rubin, help to abolish the electoral college if you believe in a strong America."

Dear [State Senator's Name],

Hey there! Hope you're doing awesome. So, I wanted to chat about this whole Electoral College thing. I've been reading up on it, and it's got me thinking. Some folks are all for keeping it, while others are pushing for a change to the popular vote. Here's my take on it.

You know, back when the Constitution was drafted, our founding crew decided to roll with the Electoral College to pick the prez. It's like this middle ground between what the people want and what Congress wants. We don't really vote for the president directly; we vote for Electors who then pick the big boss. It's a bit like a double vote – kinda wild, right? We've got 538 of these Electors, and each state gets a different number based on its crew in Congress. Even D.C. gets a piece of the action with three Electors.

So, why stick with the Electoral College? Well, it keeps things simple. Imagine if we went full popular vote – we'd be knee-deep in debates, drama, and probably some serious confusion. Like, in 2012, Obama snagged 51.3% of the popular vote, but when we checked the Electoral College score, it was a jaw-dropping 61.7%. Talk about a clear winner! No messy disputes there.

Sure, there's this buzz about Electors going rogue, like in 1960 when Louisiana almost pulled a fast one on Kennedy. But let's be real, those moments are rarer than a snow day in July. Electors usually stick with their party's pick, and ties in the Electoral College? Crazy unlikely.

And here's the real deal – the Electoral College throws some love to the big states. I mean, it makes sense, right? More people, more say. It's like a VIP pass for the larger states, and it keeps candidates from just hanging out in the popular cities. Plus, it avoids those messy runoff elections – remember 1992 and 1968? No one wants that chaos.

So, bottom line – the Electoral College keeps things straightforward, ditches the drama, and gives the big states the political muscle they deserve. Sure, it's not perfect, but what system is? And ditching it might lead to even more problems, you feel?

Thanks for listening, and if you've got thoughts, hit me back!

# Electoral College: Time for Change

## You
Write a letter to your state senator in which you argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Use the information from the texts in your essay. Manage your time carefully so that you can read the passages; plan your response; write your response; and revise and edit your response. Be sure to include a claim; address counterclaims; use evidence from multiple sources; and avoid overly relying on one source. Your response should be in the form of a multiparagraph essay. Write your response in the space provided. 

You are a US high school student. Use language fitting an average US teenager, imitating the structure and tone of the examples below. 

Example 1:
"Should we keep the electoral college? No because when you vote for your candidate in the presidential election you are actually voting for hisher electors. Also because electors can be anyone not holdin up in the public office. Finally because voters cant always control their elected electoral college member will vote for the same candidate. Over 60 percent of todays voters would prefer a more direct way of electing our officials than how we are electing them now.

Did you know that when you vote for the candidate that you want to be elected into office you are not only voting for that candidate you are actually voting for that candidates electors? Under the electoral college system us voters dont vote for the president but we vote for a slate of electors which in turn elect the candidate we voted for. Say that you voted for Obama in last years election you didnt actually vote for Obama you voted for his electors to vote for im in turn of you voting for them. Many people see this to be fine but say that your candidates electors turned and voted for someone else thus leading you down a road of betrayl. This is one important reason for the electoral party to be disbanded.

Electors that represent a candidate in the presidential run can be anyone not holding public office. Who chooses for these electors? Not the voters of course but the state and sometimes the people who you are actually voting for the electors you havent even heard of or seen in any flyers or ads. That state chooses their officials from state conventions,and even sometimes at the state partys committee or the president has his own party of electors for himself which would in a way be cheating by having your own officials vote for you.

What if the electoral party you voted for to vote for a specific candidate and they went off and changed their mind mid election and passed that countries vote for a different xcandidate in the election? You cant always control the electors to stick with them voting for the elector you voted for but without the electoral college that group of voters who voted for a candidate would actually vote for the candidate that they actually want to win. Thus making the electoral college irrelevent because they dont need to form a party and change their vorte mid election.

We should not not keep the electoral college because of all the flawls in it and the deciving image it holds up. Because you do not vote for the candidate you vote for the electorial party member representing that candidate. That the candidate can be anyone chosen by the state and you cant always control that the member of the electoral college that you voted for to vot for a different candidate that the ended up voting for during the election. This is why we dont need the electoral college to help vote for the presidents we should have a more direct way of voting."
Example 2:
"Dear Senator of Florida, Being a man of your caliber and stature you may already know about the Electoral College. This is the process that consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress. I'm writing this letter to you today because I believe that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.

The process of electoral college has been around for years. I mean think about it our founding fathers created it. Which means its four score and a thousand years too old and irrelevant to today economy. Sure it helped thousands of years ago but this the dawn of a new era. Why would it still be effective today? Its outdated! You and I both have heard the expression of "If it aint broke dont fix it." Well this the check engine light going off in your car, which means its time for a change.

Additionally, its unfair to the citizens of our nation. For instance, because each state casts only one vote, the single representatives from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Sure it helps with Wyoming and the proportionality of their representatives. But,its completely unfair to all those citizens of California who pay their taxes, work hard for their money to better their state. Take the time out in their day to vote. You're telling me that their vote doesn't have a valid say in the choosing of the President?, non sense.

Lastly, the electoral college is completely irrational. Its was created to prevent any regional favorite in voting and for a long time it has been successful in doing so. It totally contradicted itself in 2000, when the Gore had more popular votes than Bush but yet fewer electoral votes. Bush went on to win the election and manage to destroy the country along the way as well. They thought that it would never happen? I mean the amount of electoral votes is an even number538. Its unlikely I mean but its not impossible.

In closing, I just wanted to express my thoughts about the electoral vote process with you today. I believe its very unfair, outdated, and irrational. With all the infractions that can occur and risks that are involved, I believe it needs to be changed. And I believe now is time for that change! Thank you."

Example 3:
"Dear state senator, I wish to inform you about my opinion and another 60 percent of voters opinions about the Electoral college. We suggest that instead of voting for a state of electors we should vote directly to the president that we wish would lead our country. People wan't to vote straight cowardly to the exact person they perfer and not to electors whom the people can't control who they decide to vote for. Some electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate and vote for whoever they wanted to instead. Many people often get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. We also cannot choose who the electors are.

We know that the state legislatures are responsible for picking electors and that the electors that they choose always defy the will of the people. Many things can go wrong when we use electors. They could cheat into getting who they want to win. Just like how in 1960, the segregationists the the Louisiana legislature almost succeeded in their dirty plan to replace the democratic electors with new electors that would oppose John F. Kennedy meaning that they tried to get the popular vote that was for him to actually not get to Kennedy. Also, a state might send two slates of electors to congress. It's happened in Hawaii in 1960, what makes you think it won't happen again?

The electoral college is unfair to voters because of all the ways electors cheat to make sure who they wan't wins. candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all. Also 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see any campaign adds and its because of the winnertakeall system in each state.

We suggest to changing to the election by popular vote for the president of the Unites States. The citizens of the United states should be able to vote for the president that they perfer and not for an elector that could ditch the original idea and vote for only their personal opinion. There would be less flaws in the presidential electing process if we accept the popular vote method."

Dear [State Senator],

I hope this letter finds you well. As a high school student and a future voter, I have been contemplating the effectiveness of the Electoral College in our presidential elections. While some argue that the Electoral College has its merits, I firmly believe that it is time to consider a shift toward a direct popular vote for the president of the United States.

One of the primary issues with the Electoral College is the indirect nature of our votes. When we cast our ballots, we are technically voting for a slate of electors, not the presidential candidate directly. This convoluted process can lead to a sense of betrayal, as these electors may not always align with the preferences of the voters they represent. The trust we place in electors to uphold our choices can be misplaced, and this flaw undermines the essence of a democratic election.

Moreover, the selection of electors adds another layer of complexity to the system. These electors can be individuals not holding public office, chosen by the state in various ways, including state conventions or party committees. This lack of uniformity in the selection process raises concerns about the fairness and transparency of our electoral system. Voters deserve clarity about who represents them in the critical decision-making process of electing the president.

One glaring problem with the Electoral College is the potential for electors to change their allegiance mid-election. Imagine voting for a specific electoral party supporting your preferred candidate, only to have them switch their vote to another candidate during the electoral process. This possibility introduces an element of unpredictability and undermines the very purpose of representing the will of the people. Eliminating the Electoral College would mitigate such risks and allow voters to have a more direct impact on the outcome of the presidential election.

While some may argue that the Electoral College prevents candidates from focusing solely on populous states, the winner-takes-all system perpetuates a neglect of certain states altogether. In the 2000 campaign, for example, 17 states didn't see any candidates at all, and 25 of the largest media markets were left without campaign ads. A shift to a popular vote system would encourage candidates to engage with voters across the nation, ensuring a more inclusive and representative election process.

In conclusion, the flaws in the Electoral College system, such as the indirect voting process, the varied selection of electors, and the potential for electors to change their allegiance, make a compelling case for reevaluating our approach to electing the president. Transitioning to a popular vote system would provide a more direct and transparent method that aligns with the principles of a true democracy. As a young voter, I urge you to consider these concerns and advocate for a more effective and equitable electoral process.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Dear [State Senator],

Hope you're doing good. So, I've been thinking a lot about this whole Electoral College thing and whether we should stick with it or switch to a popular vote for the president. I get why some folks are all for ditching the Electoral College, but I'm not fully on board with that idea. Here's why.

First off, I get it, when we vote for a candidate, we're technically voting for their electors, not the actual president. But, like, isn't that how it's been since forever? It's like saying, "Oh, I bought a ticket to see my favorite band, but I didn't actually get to see them because I saw their backup dancers instead." It's part of the deal, you know? Plus, if we switch to a popular vote, won't it be like letting a bunch of big states overshadow the little guys? That doesn't seem fair.

I saw this other argument that electors can be anyone, not just someone holding public office. But isn't that kinda cool? It's like saying, "Hey, anyone could represent us!" Instead of having some political big shot, it could be your neighbor or your aunt who's super into politics. It's a bit like having a diverse group of people making the call, and that feels kinda democratic to me.

Okay, so there's this thing about electors changing their minds and betraying us. But let's face it, without the Electoral College, it's not like we can control everything either. People are still people, and they might switch sides or do something unexpected. It's not foolproof, you know? At least with the Electoral College, there's a bit of a process, even if it's not perfect.

And hey, I read somewhere that without the Electoral College, candidates might just focus on the big states and ignore the rest of us. Like, imagine they only cared about California and New York – what about the rest of us? With the Electoral College, they gotta think about all the states, not just the popular ones.

So, I'm thinking, maybe the Electoral College isn't all bad. It's got its quirks, sure, but it kinda evens things out, you know? I'm not saying it's perfect, but maybe instead of ditching it, we could tweak it a bit or find a middle ground. Just my two cents.

Thanks for listening,

Thus making the electoral college irrelevent because they dont need to form a party and change their vorte mid election.

We should not not keep the electoral college because of all the flawls in it and the deciving image it holds up. Because you do not vote for the candidate you vote for the electorial party member representing that candidate. That the candidate can be anyone chosen by the state and you cant always control that the member of the electoral college that you voted for to vot for a different candidate that the ended up voting for during the election. This is why we dont need the electoral college to help vote for the presidents we should have a more direct way of voting."
Example 2:
"Dear Senator of Florida, Being a man of your caliber and stature you may already know about the Electoral College. This is the process that consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress. I'm writing this letter to you today because I believe that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.

The process of electoral college has been around for years. I mean think about it our founding fathers created it. Which means its four score and a thousand years too old and irrelevant to today economy. Sure it helped thousands of years ago but this the dawn of a new era. Why would it still be effective today? Its outdated! You and I both have heard the expression of "If it aint broke dont fix it." Well this the check engine light going off in your car, which means its time for a change.

Additionally, its unfair to the citizens of our nation. For instance, because each state casts only one vote, the single representatives from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Sure it helps with Wyoming and the proportionality of their representatives. But,its completely unfair to all those citizens of California who pay their taxes, work hard for their money to better their state. Take the time out in their day to vote. You're telling me that their vote doesn't have a valid say in the choosing of the President?, non sense.

Lastly, the electoral college is completely irrational. Its was created to prevent any regional favorite in voting and for a long time it has been successful in doing so. It totally contradicted itself in 2000, when the Gore had more popular votes than Bush but yet fewer electoral votes. Bush went on to win the election and manage to destroy the country along the way as well. They thought that it would never happen? I mean the amount of electoral votes is an even number538. Its unlikely I mean but its not impossible.

In closing, I just wanted to express my thoughts about the electoral vote process with you today. I believe its very unfair, outdated, and irrational. With all the infractions that can occur and risks that are involved, I believe it needs to be changed. And I believe now is time for that change! Thank you."

Example 3:
"Dear state senator, I wish to inform you about my opinion and another 60 percent of voters opinions about the Electoral college. We suggest that instead of voting for a state of electors we should vote directly to the president that we wish would lead our country. People wan't to vote straight cowardly to the exact person they perfer and not to electors whom the people can't control who they decide to vote for. Some electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate and vote for whoever they wanted to instead. Many people often get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. We also cannot choose who the electors are.

We know that the state legislatures are responsible for picking electors and that the electors that they choose always defy the will of the people. Many things can go wrong when we use electors. They could cheat into getting who they want to win. Just like how in 1960, the segregationists the the Louisiana legislature almost succeeded in their dirty plan to replace the democratic electors with new electors that would oppose John F. Kennedy meaning that they tried to get the popular vote that was for him to actually not get to Kennedy. Also, a state might send two slates of electors to congress. It's happened in Hawaii in 1960, what makes you think it won't happen again?

The electoral college is unfair to voters because of all the ways electors cheat to make sure who they wan't wins. candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all. Also 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see any campaign adds and its because of the winnertakeall system in each state.

We suggest to changing to the election by popular vote for the president of the Unites States. The citizens of the United states should be able to vote for the president that they perfer and not for an elector that could ditch the original idea and vote for only their personal opinion. There would be less flaws in the presidential electing process if we accept the popular vote method."

Dear [State Senator],

Hey, hope you're good! So, I've been thinking a lot about this whole Electoral College versus popular vote thing, and honestly, it's a bit of a head-scratcher. I get that some folks are all about scrapping the Electoral College, but I'm not entirely convinced. Here's why.

Okay, so the first argument is that when we vote, we're technically voting for electors, not the actual president. I get it, it seems a bit roundabout, like buying a concert ticket but only seeing the opening act. But, like, isn't that how it's always been? Changing it might sound cool, but what if the big states start overshadowing the little guys? That doesn't feel right to me.

And yeah, electors can be anyone, not just people holding public office. But think about it – isn't it kinda neat having regular folks as electors? It's like saying, "Hey, anyone can represent us!" Instead of some political big shot, it could be your neighbor or your cool aunt who's super into politics. It's a bit like getting a mix of voices, you know?

Then there's this deal about electors changing their minds and going rogue. But let's be real, without the Electoral College, can we control everything either? People are unpredictable; they might switch sides or do something unexpected. At least with the Electoral College, there's a bit of a system, even if it's not perfect.

Now, I read somewhere that without the Electoral College, candidates might just focus on the big states and ignore the rest of us. Like, imagine they only cared about California and New York – what about the rest of us? With the Electoral College, they gotta think about all the states, not just the popular ones.

Sure, it's not perfect, and I hear the arguments against it. But is scrapping the whole thing the answer? I'm not sold on that. Maybe we could tweak it or find a middle ground instead of throwing the whole system out.

Thanks for listening,

Write a letter to your state senator in which you argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Use the information from the texts in your essay. Manage your time carefully so that you can read the passages; plan your response; write your response; and revise and edit your response. Be sure to include a claim; address counterclaims; use evidence from multiple sources; and avoid overly relying on one source. Your response should be in the form of a multiparagraph essay. Write your response in the space provided. 

You are a US high school student. Use language fitting an average US teenager, imitating the structure and tone of the examples below. 

Example 1:
"Should we keep the electoral college? No because when you vote for your candidate in the presidential election you are actually voting for hisher electors. Also because electors can be anyone not holdin up in the public office. Finally because voters cant always control their elected electoral college member will vote for the same candidate. Over 60 percent of todays voters would prefer a more direct way of electing our officials than how we are electing them now.

Did you know that when you vote for the candidate that you want to be elected into office you are not only voting for that candidate you are actually voting for that candidates electors? Under the electoral college system us voters dont vote for the president but we vote for a slate of electors which in turn elect the candidate we voted for. Say that you voted for Obama in last years election you didnt actually vote for Obama you voted for his electors to vote for im in turn of you voting for them. Many people see this to be fine but say that your candidates electors turned and voted for someone else thus leading you down a road of betrayl. This is one important reason for the electoral party to be disbanded.

Electors that represent a candidate in the presidential run can be anyone not holding public office. Who chooses for these electors? Not the voters of course but the state and sometimes the people who you are actually voting for the electors you havent even heard of or seen in any flyers or ads. That state chooses their officials from state conventions,and even sometimes at the state partys committee or the president has his own party of electors for himself which would in a way be cheating by having your own officials vote for you.

What if the electoral party you voted for to vote for a specific candidate and they went off and changed their mind mid election and passed that countries vote for a different xcandidate in the election? You cant always control the electors to stick with them voting for the elector you voted for but without the electoral college that group of voters who voted for a candidate would actually vote for the candidate that they actually want to win. Thus making the electoral college irrelevent because they dont need to form a party and change their vorte mid election.

We should not not keep the electoral college because of all the flawls in it and the deciving image it holds up. Because you do not vote for the candidate you vote for the electorial party member representing that candidate. That the candidate can be anyone chosen by the state and you cant always control that the member of the electoral college that you voted for to vot for a different candidate that the ended up voting for during the election. This is why we dont need the electoral college to help vote for the presidents we should have a more direct way of voting."

Dear [Senator's Name],

Hope this letter finds you chill. I wanted to throw my two cents into the mix about the whole Electoral College debate. It's like a hot topic, right? Some say we should keep it, others are all about switching to the popular vote. Here's where I'm at.

So, keeping the Electoral College – it's got its quirks, but it's not all bad. I get it, voting for electors instead of the actual president seems a bit weird. But, like, it's been working, hasn't it? It's like a system our folks set up ages ago, and yeah, maybe it's not perfect, but it's got a rhythm.

You know how electors can be anyone, not just the big shots? That's kinda cool. It's like saying, "Hey, regular folks can be part of this too!" Imagine your neighbor or your cool aunt being an elector. It's a bit like adding a personal touch to the whole political scene.

Then there's this idea that electors can switch sides and mess everything up. But come on, can we control everything? People are unpredictable. Without the Electoral College, won't there be chaos too? At least with it, there's a bit of structure, even if it's not flawless.

And what if, without the Electoral College, candidates only focus on the big states? The little guys might get overlooked. I mean, every state should matter, right? With the Electoral College, it's like making sure everyone gets a slice of the political pie.

But hey, I hear the other side too. Like, yeah, it's been around forever, and maybe it's time for a change. But is scrapping the whole thing the answer? It's like throwing out the whole pizza because one slice is a bit off.

Thanks for listening, Senator. Keep doing your thing.

Peace out,
