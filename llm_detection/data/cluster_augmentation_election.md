# What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register

1 The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

2 The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

3 The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . .

4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word “state” also refers to the District of Columbia.

5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate’s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .

6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state’s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate’s electors.

7 Most states have a “winner-take-all” system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of “proportional representation.” . . .

8 After the presidential election, your governor prepares a “Certificate of Ascertainment” listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state’s Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer

9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college

10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?

12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .

14 It’s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It’s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

# In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner

15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you’re actually voting for a slate of electors.

16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party’s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed) . . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons.

1) Certainty of Outcome

18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible—--it happened in 2000--—but it’s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012’s election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes—--538—--is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . .

2) Everyone’s President

19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised—to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn’t their president.

 3) Swing States

20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.
4) Big States

21 The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .

5) Avoid Run-Off Elections

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

The Electoral College has been a crucial component of the U.S. presidential election process since the country's inception. While some argue for its abolition, citing issues of fairness and democratic representation, it is essential to recognize the practical advantages it offers. The Electoral College, comprising 538 electors, serves as a compromise between direct popular vote and congressional selection, as outlined in the Constitution.

Critics often point to the potential for discrepancies between the popular and electoral votes, as witnessed in 2000 when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency. However, the rarity of such occurrences and the historical precedent of a close alignment between the two votes suggest that the system generally reflects the will of the people. Judge Richard A. Posner argues that the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome, minimizing the likelihood of disputes over election results. The winner-take-all approach in most states contributes to this certainty, creating a clear electoral victory even with a slight popular vote plurality.

Another compelling aspect of the Electoral College is its encouragement of trans-regional appeal. Candidates must garner support across various regions to secure victory, preventing a scenario where a candidate with only regional backing assumes office. This fosters a sense of national representation and prevents disenfranchisement among voters from less populated regions who might otherwise feel ignored.

The focus on swing states during campaigns is often criticized, but it serves a crucial purpose. Swing states force candidates to engage with a diverse range of voters, promoting a more informed electorate. Posner contends that thoughtful voters in these states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, ensuring that those deciding the election are well-informed and engaged citizens.

Furthermore, the Electoral College addresses the imbalance in political weight between large and small states. By allocating electoral votes based on the number of representatives and senators, the system ensures that candidates pay attention to the concerns of both densely and sparsely populated states. This balanced approach prevents large states from dominating the political discourse at the expense of smaller ones.

The Electoral College also eliminates the need for runoff elections, a potential complication in the event of no candidate securing a majority of popular votes. This ensures a decisive outcome in every presidential election, reducing the likelihood of prolonged uncertainty and political instability.

While the critics argue that the winner-take-all system can lead to candidates neglecting states where they have no chance of winning, this approach actually ensures that campaigns remain focused on competitive states. The intense competition for electoral votes motivates candidates to address the concerns of a broad cross-section of the population, rather than concentrating solely on densely populated urban areas.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, despite its imperfections, plays a crucial role in maintaining a balanced and representative democracy. Its advantages in ensuring a certain outcome, promoting trans-regional appeal, and preventing political imbalance are essential considerations in any debate about its future. While calls for its abolition persist, the system's practical benefits contribute to a more robust and inclusive electoral process for the presidency of the United States.

Dear [State Senator],

I am writing to express my support for the retention of the Electoral College in the election process for the President of the United States. This system, established by the founding fathers in the Constitution, serves as a crucial compromise between direct popular vote and congressional selection, providing a balance that ensures the fair representation of diverse interests across the nation.

One of the primary strengths of the Electoral College lies in its ability to guarantee a certainty of outcome. Judge Richard A. Posner notes that disputes over the Electoral College results are less likely than those over the popular vote. The winner-take-all system in most states contributes to this certainty, as even a slight plurality in a state creates a decisive electoral-vote victory. This helps avoid prolonged disputes and political instability, providing a clear winner in each presidential election.

Critics argue that the Electoral College can lead to scenarios where the popular vote winner does not secure the presidency, as seen in 2000. While this is a rare occurrence, the system's focus on trans-regional appeal is a vital aspect. Candidates must appeal to a broad spectrum of voters across different regions to secure victory, preventing a candidate with only regional backing from assuming office. This ensures that the president represents the entire nation and not just specific regions.

Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages candidates to address the concerns of swing states, fostering a more informed electorate. As Bradford Plumer notes, voters in toss-up states are likely to be the most thoughtful, paying close attention to campaign details. This approach ensures that those deciding the election are well-informed and engaged citizens, contributing to a robust democratic process.

Judge Posner also highlights the significance of the Electoral College in addressing the political imbalance between large and small states. By allocating electoral votes based on the number of representatives and senators, the system ensures that candidates pay attention to the concerns of both densely and sparsely populated states. This balanced approach prevents large states from dominating the political discourse at the expense of smaller ones.

In conclusion, while the Electoral College is not without its flaws, it plays a crucial role in maintaining a balanced and representative democracy. Its advantages in ensuring a certain outcome, promoting trans-regional appeal, and preventing political imbalance are essential considerations in any debate about its future. As a concerned citizen, I urge you to carefully weigh the practical benefits of the Electoral College and consider the potential consequences of a shift to a direct popular vote.

Sincerely,

Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?

12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .

14 It’s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It’s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

# In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner

15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you’re actually voting for a slate of electors.

16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party’s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed) . . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons.

1) Certainty of Outcome

18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible—--it happened in 2000--—but it’s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012’s election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes—--538—--is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . .

2) Everyone’s President

19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised—to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn’t their president.

 3) Swing States

20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.
4) Big States

21 The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .

5) Avoid Run-Off Elections

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

The debate surrounding the Electoral College versus a direct popular vote for the election of the President of the United States has been ongoing, with both sides presenting compelling arguments. While critics argue that the Electoral College is undemocratic and prone to potential issues, defenders, including Judge Richard A. Posner, emphasize its practical benefits. In this essay, I will argue in favor of maintaining the Electoral College, drawing evidence from multiple sources.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College, as highlighted by Judge Posner, is the certainty of outcome. The winner-take-all system in most states ensures that the candidate who secures the Electoral College also generally secures a significant majority of the popular vote. This reduces the likelihood of prolonged disputes and provides a clear and decisive outcome in each presidential election. In contrast, a direct popular vote could lead to disputes over close margins, potentially resulting in political instability and uncertainty.

Critics of the Electoral College, as voiced by Bradford Plumer, argue that it is prone to a "disaster factor," where state legislatures or "faithless" electors could undermine the will of the people. While historical instances, such as the 1960 attempt in Louisiana, raise concerns, the rarity of such events suggests that the system has generally functioned as intended. The potential for electors to act against the popular vote is outweighed by the overall stability provided by the Electoral College.

Another key argument in favor of the Electoral College is its role in ensuring that presidential candidates have trans-regional appeal, preventing candidates with only regional support from assuming office. As Judge Posner points out, no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, compelling candidates to appeal to a broad spectrum of voters across different states. This ensures that the president represents the interests of the entire nation, fostering national unity.

Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages candidates to address the concerns of swing states, as highlighted by Plumer. This results in a more informed electorate in these states, as voters become more engaged and attentive to campaign details, knowing that they hold significant influence in deciding the election. This focus on swing states fosters a more thoughtful and engaged electorate, contributing to a robust democratic process.

In conclusion, while criticisms of the Electoral College exist, its practical benefits in ensuring a clear outcome, promoting trans-regional appeal, and engaging voters in swing states cannot be ignored. The system has demonstrated resilience and stability over time, contributing to the overall health of the democratic process in the United States. As such, I urge you to consider the multifaceted advantages of the Electoral College in making informed decisions regarding its retention or potential reform.

# What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register

1 The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

2 The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

3 The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . .

4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word “state” also refers to the District of Columbia.

5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate’s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .

6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state’s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate’s electors.

7 Most states have a “winner-take-all” system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of “proportional representation.” . . .

8 After the presidential election, your governor prepares a “Certificate of Ascertainment” listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state’s Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer

9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college

10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960.

20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.
4) Big States

21 The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .

5) Avoid Run-Off Elections

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

The Electoral College has been a subject of debate, with arguments both for and against its continuation. As a concerned citizen, I believe that the Electoral College, despite its imperfections, remains a crucial component of the American democratic process. Several key aspects, as outlined by the Office of the Federal Register and Judge Richard A. Posner, highlight the importance of maintaining the Electoral College.

One fundamental argument in favor of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. The winner-take-all system, as emphasized by Judge Posner, ensures that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College generally exceeds their share of the popular vote. This reduces the likelihood of prolonged disputes, providing a clear and decisive result in each presidential election (Posner, 18). A direct popular vote could lead to disputes over close margins, potentially resulting in political instability and uncertainty, which the Electoral College helps mitigate.

Critics, as articulated by Bradford Plumer, often highlight the potential "disaster factor" associated with the Electoral College. Instances of state legislatures attempting to influence electors or electors acting against the popular vote have occurred in history. However, these occurrences are rare, and the overall stability provided by the Electoral College outweighs the risk of such incidents (Plumer, 11). The system has demonstrated resilience and has ensured a relatively smooth transition of power throughout American history.

Another crucial aspect is the trans-regional appeal required by the Electoral College, as pointed out by Judge Posner. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, compelling candidates to appeal to a broad spectrum of voters across different states. This prevents candidates with only regional support from assuming office, fostering national unity and ensuring that the president represents the interests of the entire nation (Posner, 19).

Furthermore, the focus on swing states, as noted by Judge Posner and Bradford Plumer, is a key advantage of the Electoral College. The winner-take-all method encourages candidates to address the concerns of these states, resulting in a more informed electorate. Voters in swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, fostering a more engaged and thoughtful electorate, which is essential for a robust democratic process (Posner, 20).

In conclusion, while the Electoral College has its imperfections, it serves as a vital mechanism in the American democratic process. The system's ability to provide a clear outcome, ensure trans-regional appeal, and engage voters in swing states contributes to the overall health and stability of the democratic process. I urge you, as my state senator, to consider these multifaceted advantages when evaluating the arguments for and against the Electoral College. Abandoning this system may introduce unforeseen challenges and risks to the democratic process, and careful consideration of its strengths is essential for informed decision-making.

# What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register

1 The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

2 The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

3 The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . .

4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word “state” also refers to the District of Columbia.

5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate’s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .

6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state’s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate’s electors.

7 Most states have a “winner-take-all” system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of “proportional representation.” . . .

8 After the presidential election, your governor prepares a “Certificate of Ascertainment” listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state’s Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer

9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college

10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?

12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .

14 It’s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It’s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

# In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner

15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you’re actually voting for a slate of electors.

16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party’s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed) . . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons.

1) Certainty of Outcome

18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible—--it happened in 2000--—but it’s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012’s election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes—--538—--is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . .

2) Everyone’s President

19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised—to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn’t their president.

 3) Swing States

20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.
4) Big States

21 The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .

5) Avoid Run-Off Elections

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

The Electoral College, despite its imperfections, remains a cornerstone of the American democratic process, striking a delicate balance between the popular will and the diverse interests of the states. As elucidated by the Office of the Federal Register and Judge Richard A. Posner, the Electoral College serves several crucial functions that contribute to the stability and fairness of the presidential election system.

One fundamental aspect in favor of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. As highlighted by Judge Posner, the winner-take-all system ensures that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College generally exceeds their share of the popular vote. This significantly reduces the likelihood of prolonged disputes over election results, providing a clear and decisive outcome in each presidential election (Posner, 18). This certainty is crucial for maintaining political stability and public confidence in the democratic process.

Critics, as articulated by Bradford Plumer, often emphasize the potential "disaster factor" associated with the Electoral College. Instances of state legislatures attempting to influence electors or electors acting against the popular vote have occurred in history. However, these occurrences are rare, and the overall stability provided by the Electoral College outweighs the risk of such incidents (Plumer, 11). The system has demonstrated resilience and has ensured a relatively smooth transition of power throughout American history.

Another essential aspect is the trans-regional appeal required by the Electoral College, as pointed out by Judge Posner. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, compelling candidates to appeal to a broad spectrum of voters across different states. This prevents candidates with only regional support from assuming office, fostering national unity and ensuring that the president represents the interests of the entire nation (Posner, 19).

Furthermore, the focus on swing states, as noted by Judge Posner and Bradford Plumer, is a key advantage of the Electoral College. The winner-take-all method encourages candidates to address the concerns of these states, resulting in a more informed and engaged electorate. Voters in swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, fostering a more thoughtful electorate, which is essential for a robust democratic process (Posner, 20).

In conclusion, the Electoral College, with its unique features, contributes significantly to the overall health and stability of the American democratic process. The certainty of outcome, trans-regional appeal, and focus on swing states are vital components that should be carefully considered. While no system is without flaws, the Electoral College has stood the test of time and continues to play a crucial role in maintaining a balanced and representative democracy. As my state senator, I urge you to consider these multifaceted advantages when evaluating the arguments for and against the Electoral College. Abandoning this system may introduce unforeseen challenges and risks to the democratic process, and careful consideration of its strengths is essential for informed decision-making.

20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.
4) Big States

21 The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .

5) Avoid Run-Off Elections

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

The Electoral College, established by the founding fathers as a compromise between direct congressional election and a popular vote, plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability and fairness of the American presidential election system. While critics, as exemplified by Bradford Plumer, argue against the Electoral College, citing potential pitfalls such as the "disaster factor" and unfairness to voters, it is imperative to consider the multifaceted advantages presented by the system, as outlined by the Office of the Federal Register and Judge Richard A. Posner.

One key advantage of the Electoral College, as noted by Judge Posner, is the certainty of outcome. The winner-take-all system minimizes the likelihood of prolonged disputes over election results, providing a clear and decisive outcome in each presidential election (Posner, 18). This is crucial for maintaining political stability and public confidence in the democratic process, as witnessed by the relatively smooth transitions of power throughout American history.

Addressing the concerns raised by critics, it is important to acknowledge the potential pitfalls highlighted by Bradford Plumer, such as the "disaster factor" and the focus on swing states. However, as history indicates, occurrences of electors defying the will of the people or sending two slates of electors to Congress are rare and have not significantly undermined the overall integrity of the Electoral College system.

Judge Posner's argument regarding the trans-regional appeal required by the Electoral College is noteworthy. This aspect prevents candidates with only regional support from assuming office, fostering national unity and ensuring that the president represents the interests of the entire nation (Posner, 19).

Furthermore, the focus on swing states, while criticized for creating an uneven distribution of attention, has the advantage of encouraging candidates to address the concerns of diverse populations. This ensures a more informed and engaged electorate in crucial swing states, contributing to a more thoughtful democratic process (Posner, 20).

In conclusion, the Electoral College, despite its imperfections, remains a vital mechanism in the American democratic process. The certainty of outcome, trans-regional appeal, and focus on swing states contribute significantly to the overall health and stability of the democratic process. While there are valid concerns raised by critics, a careful consideration of the system's strengths, as outlined by Judge Posner and the Office of the Federal Register, is essential for making informed decisions about its continuation or potential reform. As my state senator, I urge you to weigh these advantages carefully when evaluating the arguments for and against the Electoral College. Abandoning this system may introduce unforeseen challenges and risks to the democratic process, and a thoughtful assessment of its strengths is imperative for informed decision-making.

# What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register

1 The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

2 The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

3 The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . .

4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word “state” also refers to the District of Columbia.

5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate’s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .

6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state’s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate’s electors.

7 Most states have a “winner-take-all” system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of “proportional representation.” . . .

8 After the presidential election, your governor prepares a “Certificate of Ascertainment” listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state’s Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer

9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college

10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?

12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .

14 It’s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It’s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

# In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner

15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you’re actually voting for a slate of electors.

16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party’s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed) . . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons.

1) Certainty of Outcome

18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible—--it happened in 2000--—but it’s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012’s election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes—--538—--is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . .

2) Everyone’s President

19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised—to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn’t their president.

 3) Swing States

20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.
4) Big States

21 The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .

5) Avoid Run-Off Elections

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

The debate over the Electoral College versus a popular vote system for electing the President of the United States has been ongoing, with passionate arguments on both sides. As a concerned citizen, I believe that the Electoral College, despite its imperfections, serves essential functions in preserving the integrity and stability of the American electoral process.

One of the primary virtues of the Electoral College, as highlighted by the Office of the Federal Register and Judge Richard A. Posner, is the certainty of outcome (Posner, 18). The winner-take-all system ensures that the winning candidate's share of electoral votes typically exceeds their share of the popular vote, minimizing the likelihood of disputes over election results. This has contributed to the smooth transitions of power throughout American history, fostering stability and public confidence in the democratic process.

While Bradford Plumer raises valid concerns about the potential pitfalls of the Electoral College, such as the "disaster factor" and the focus on swing states, it is crucial to note that these occurrences are rare and have not significantly compromised the overall integrity of the system. The "disaster factor" refers to the potential for electors to defy the will of the people, but historical instances of faithless electors have been infrequent and have not resulted in widespread election crises (Plumer, 11).

Additionally, the focus on swing states, criticized for creating an uneven distribution of attention, has the advantage of encouraging candidates to address the concerns of diverse populations. This ensures a more informed and engaged electorate in crucial swing states, contributing to a more thoughtful democratic process (Posner, 20).

Furthermore, the Electoral College's requirement for a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, as pointed out by Judge Posner, prevents candidates with only regional support from assuming office. This fosters national unity and ensures that the president represents the interests of the entire nation (Posner, 19).

In conclusion, while arguments for a popular vote system are compelling, it is crucial to recognize the valuable functions that the Electoral College serves in maintaining a stable and effective electoral process. The certainty of outcome, trans-regional appeal requirement, and focus on swing states contribute significantly to the overall health of the democratic process. As my state senator, I urge you to consider these factors when evaluating the arguments for and against the Electoral College. Abandoning this system may introduce unforeseen challenges and risks to the democratic process, and a thoughtful assessment of its strengths is imperative for informed decision-making.

The Electoral College has been a cornerstone of the American democratic process since its inception, providing a unique and effective method for electing the President. While there are valid concerns raised by critics, it is crucial to recognize the system's inherent strengths and the reasons it has endured over the years.

One of the fundamental aspects of the Electoral College, as explained by the Office of the Federal Register, is its origin as a compromise between a direct popular vote and congressional selection (Federal Register, 1). This compromise reflects the Founding Fathers' wisdom in seeking a balance between the will of the people and the need to prevent the tyranny of the majority. The Electoral College serves as a middle ground, ensuring that both individual citizens and states play a role in the presidential election process.

Critics argue that the Electoral College system can lead to scenarios where the popular vote winner does not secure the presidency, as seen in 2000. However, as Judge Richard A. Posner points out, such instances are rare and do not undermine the overall legitimacy of the system (Posner, 18). The Electoral College's winner-take-all approach in most states ensures that the winning candidate's share of electoral votes exceeds their popular vote percentage, minimizing the likelihood of disputes.

While Bradford Plumer raises concerns about the so-called "disaster factor" and the potential for tied electoral votes, these instances have been historically infrequent (Plumer, 11). The Electoral College's ability to provide a clear and decisive outcome in most cases is a strength rather than a weakness. In contrast, a popular vote system could lead to frequent run-off elections, significantly complicating the electoral process (Posner, 22).

Moreover, the Electoral College encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal, preventing them from focusing solely on areas with large populations. This requirement, as emphasized by Posner, ensures that presidential candidates must address the concerns of diverse regions, fostering a more inclusive and representative leadership (Posner, 19).

In conclusion, the Electoral College, with its historical roots and practical benefits, remains a vital component of the American electoral system. While it is essential to address concerns and make necessary adjustments, completely abandoning the Electoral College risks compromising the delicate balance it provides. As your constituent, I urge you to consider the enduring strengths of the Electoral College and carefully weigh the potential consequences of any proposed changes to our electoral process.

# What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register

1 The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

2 The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

3 The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . .

4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word “state” also refers to the District of Columbia.

5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate’s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .

6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state’s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate’s electors.

7 Most states have a “winner-take-all” system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of “proportional representation.” . . .

8 After the presidential election, your governor prepares a “Certificate of Ascertainment” listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state’s Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer

9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college

10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?

12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .

14 It’s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It’s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

# In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner

15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you’re actually voting for a slate of electors.

16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party’s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed) . . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons.

1) Certainty of Outcome

18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible—--it happened in 2000--—but it’s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012’s election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes—--538—--is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . .

2) Everyone’s President

19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised—to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn’t their president.

 3) Swing States

20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.
4) Big States

21 The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .

5) Avoid Run-Off Elections

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

The Electoral College, established by the Founding Fathers as a compromise between congressional selection and a direct popular vote, has been a crucial component of the American democratic process. While critics, such as Bradford Plumer, argue for its abolition, it is essential to consider the system's historical significance and the practical advantages it offers.

One of the primary functions of the Electoral College, outlined by the Office of the Federal Register, is its role in balancing the interests of both individual citizens and states in the election process (Federal Register, 1). The allocation of electors based on the Congressional delegation ensures that states, both large and small, play a role in determining the President. This prevents the dominance of a few populous states over the entire nation and fosters a more inclusive representation.

Plumer raises concerns about the potential "disaster factor," referencing historical instances where state legislatures attempted to replace electors or electors acted against the will of the people. While these are valid concerns, such occurrences have been rare, and the system has generally provided a stable and reliable outcome (Plumer, 11). Furthermore, Judge Richard A. Posner emphasizes the Electoral College's ability to avoid run-off elections, a scenario that could significantly complicate the electoral process (Posner, 22).

Posner also highlights that the Electoral College encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal, preventing them from focusing solely on densely populated areas. This requirement ensures that presidential candidates address the concerns of diverse regions, promoting a more balanced and representative leadership (Posner, 19).

The winner-take-all method in most states, as described by Posner, also incentivizes candidates to focus on swing states, encouraging thoughtful campaigning in areas where the outcome is less certain (Posner, 20). This approach promotes engagement and attentiveness among voters, particularly in those states that have the power to swing the election.

While critics like Plumer argue that the Electoral College is unfair to voters in states where candidates have no chance of winning, Posner contends that the system prevents candidates from catering only to certain regions and ensures that candidates must have broad appeal (Posner, 19).

In conclusion, the Electoral College, though imperfect, has proven to be a resilient and effective method for electing the President. Its historical significance, coupled with practical advantages such as avoiding run-off elections and promoting trans-regional appeal, makes it a valuable institution in the American electoral system. While acknowledging concerns raised by critics, it is crucial to consider the system's overall benefits and carefully weigh the consequences before advocating for significant changes.

Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

The Electoral College, enshrined in the Constitution by the Founding Fathers, has been a cornerstone of the American electoral system for centuries. While critics like Bradford Plumer advocate for its abolition, there are compelling reasons to retain this system that serves as a crucial compromise between congressional selection and a direct popular vote.

One of the fundamental advantages of the Electoral College, as outlined by the Office of the Federal Register, is its ability to balance the interests of both individual citizens and states (Federal Register, 1). This ensures that states, regardless of size, play a role in determining the President, preventing the dominance of a few populous states over the entire nation. The allocation of electors based on the Congressional delegation underscores the Founding Fathers' intent to create a system that respects both individual and state-level voices.

Critics, including Plumer, point to the potential issues with "faithless" electors and the possibility of electors going against the popular vote. While these concerns are valid, historical instances of such occurrences have been rare, and the overall stability of the Electoral College has been a testament to its resilience (Plumer, 11). Judge Richard A. Posner further argues that the Electoral College avoids the problem of run-off elections, which could significantly complicate the electoral process (Posner, 22).

Posner also emphasizes that the Electoral College encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal, preventing them from focusing solely on densely populated areas (Posner, 19). This ensures that presidential candidates address the concerns of diverse regions, promoting a more balanced and representative leadership.

This approach promotes engagement and attentiveness among voters, particularly in those states that have the power to swing the election.

While Plumer contends that the Electoral College is unfair to voters in states where candidates have no chance of winning, Posner argues that the system prevents candidates from catering only to certain regions and ensures that candidates must have broad appeal (Posner, 19).

In conclusion, the Electoral College, despite its imperfections, remains a vital institution in the American electoral system. Its historical significance, coupled with practical advantages such as avoiding run-off elections and promoting trans-regional appeal, underscores its importance. While critics raise valid concerns, it is crucial to consider the system's overall benefits and carefully weigh the consequences before advocating for significant changes. The Electoral College continues to play a crucial role in preserving the delicate balance between individual and state-level representation in the American democratic process.

Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .

14 It’s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It’s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

# In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner

15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you’re actually voting for a slate of electors.

16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party’s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed) . . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons.

1) Certainty of Outcome

18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible—--it happened in 2000--—but it’s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012’s election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes—--538—--is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . .

2) Everyone’s President

19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised—to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn’t their president.

 3) Swing States

20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.
4) Big States

21 The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .

5) Avoid Run-Off Elections

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

Dear [State Senator],

The question of whether to keep the Electoral College or transition to a popular vote for the election of the President of the United States is a contentious issue with strong arguments on both sides. As a concerned citizen, I would like to advocate for the retention of the Electoral College, given its historical significance and practical advantages outlined by the Office of the Federal Register and Judge Richard A. Posner.

Firstly, the Electoral College serves as a crucial compromise between a direct popular vote and the election of the President by Congress (Federal Register, 1). It reflects the Founding Fathers' intent to balance the interests of individual citizens and states, preventing the dominance of a few populous states over the entire nation (Federal Register, 1).

Critics like Bradford Plumer argue against the Electoral College, citing concerns about "faithless" electors and the potential for electors to defy the will of the people (Plumer, 11). While these concerns are valid, historical instances of such occurrences have been rare, and the overall stability of the Electoral College has been a testament to its resilience (Plumer, 11). Additionally, Posner emphasizes that each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee, reducing the likelihood of such betrayals (Posner, 16).

The Electoral College, as Posner argues, promotes trans-regional appeal for presidential candidates, preventing them from focusing solely on densely populated areas (Posner, 19). This ensures that candidates address the concerns of diverse regions, promoting a more balanced and representative leadership.

Posner further highlights the importance of swing states in the Electoral College system, where the winner-take-all method encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts (Posner, 20). This approach promotes engagement and attentiveness among voters, particularly in those states that have the power to swing the election.

The system also restores balance to the political influence of large and small states, as large states receive more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than small states (Posner, 21). This is particularly crucial in maintaining a fair representation of diverse perspectives across the nation.

While Plumer contends that the winner-take-all system in each state is unfair to voters, Posner argues that it prevents candidates from catering only to certain regions and ensures that candidates must have broad appeal (Posner, 19). The Electoral College encourages candidates to appeal to a wide range of voters rather than focusing solely on specific demographics.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, despite its imperfections, remains a vital institution in the American electoral system. Its historical significance, coupled with practical advantages such as avoiding run-off elections and promoting trans-regional appeal, underscores its importance. While critics raise valid concerns, it is crucial to consider the system's overall benefits and carefully weigh the consequences before advocating for significant changes. The Electoral College continues to play a crucial role in preserving the delicate balance between individual and state-level representation in the American democratic process.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

# What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register

1 The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

2 The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

3 The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . .

4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word “state” also refers to the District of Columbia.

5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate’s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .

6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state’s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate’s electors.

7 Most states have a “winner-take-all” system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of “proportional representation.” . . .

8 After the presidential election, your governor prepares a “Certificate of Ascertainment” listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state’s Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer

9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college

10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?

12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.

The debate over the Electoral College versus a direct popular vote for the election of the President of the United States has been a longstanding and divisive issue. While critics argue that the Electoral College is outdated and inherently flawed, there are compelling reasons to retain this system, as outlined by the Office of the Federal Register and Judge Richard A. Posner.

The Electoral College, as explained by the Office of the Federal Register, was established as a compromise between electing the President through a congressional vote and a popular vote of qualified citizens (Federal Register, 1). It serves as a process, not a place, and consists of 538 electors, with a majority of 270 electoral votes required to elect the President (Federal Register, 3). This structure ensures a balanced representation of both individual citizens and states in the electoral process.

One of the primary criticisms of the Electoral College, as articulated by Bradford Plumer, is the potential for "faithless" electors and the disaster factor, where state legislatures could defy the will of the people (Plumer, 11). However, Judge Posner counters these concerns by emphasizing that instances of faithless electors have been rare, and historical stability suggests the system's reliability (Posner, 16). While Plumer highlights the 2000 election crisis, Posner argues that the Electoral College's structure provides certainty of outcome, reducing the likelihood of disputes over the results (Posner, 18).

Posner further contends that the Electoral College promotes trans-regional appeal for presidential candidates, preventing them from focusing solely on densely populated areas (Posner, 19). This prevents candidates from neglecting the interests of certain regions and ensures a more balanced and representative leadership.

The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes, criticized by Plumer as unfair to voters, is defended by Posner as a mechanism that prevents candidates from catering only to specific regions and promotes broad appeal (Posner, 19). The Electoral College encourages candidates to consider the diverse interests of voters across the nation.

Posner's argument in favor of the Electoral College extends to its role in maintaining balance between large and small states. The Electoral College restores political weight to large states, ensuring they receive attention from presidential candidates in campaigns (Posner, 21). This is essential for a fair representation of diverse perspectives across the nation.

Moreover, the Electoral College avoids the problem of run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes, as demonstrated in the elections of Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 (Posner, 22). This prevents additional complications in the presidential election process and ensures a clear winner.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, despite its imperfections, plays a crucial role in the American democratic process. Its historical significance, along with practical advantages such as preventing run-off elections and promoting trans-regional appeal, makes a strong case for its retention. While critics raise valid concerns, it is important to consider the system's overall benefits and carefully weigh the consequences before advocating for significant changes.

20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.
4) Big States

21 The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .

5) Avoid Run-Off Elections

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

The Electoral College has been a fundamental aspect of the American electoral system since the inception of the Constitution. While some argue for its abolition, I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be retained due to its historical significance and the practical advantages it provides in the election process.

One key argument in favor of the Electoral College, as highlighted by the Office of the Federal Register, is its role as a compromise between the election of the President by Congress and a popular vote of citizens (Federal Register, 1). This compromise is crucial in maintaining a balance between federal and state interests, preventing the dominance of heavily populated states over smaller ones.

Judge Richard A. Posner further defends the Electoral College, citing the certainty of outcome as a significant advantage. The winner-take-all system in most states ensures that even a slight plurality in a state results in a decisive electoral victory (Posner, 18). This reduces the likelihood of disputes over the election results and provides stability in the electoral process.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal, preventing them from focusing solely on densely populated areas. This ensures that candidates consider the diverse interests of voters across the nation, preventing the neglect of certain regions (Posner, 19).

The concept of swing states, highlighted by Posner, is another crucial aspect of the Electoral College. The winner-take-all method encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on toss-up states, where voters are more likely to pay close attention to the competing candidates (Posner, 20). This results in a more informed and engaged electorate, as opposed to a system where candidates might only concentrate on high-population areas.

Moreover, the Electoral College avoids the problem of run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes. This is exemplified by historical instances where candidates with a plurality of popular votes won a clear majority in the Electoral College, preventing the need for additional and complicated run-off elections (Posner, 22).

While critics, as presented by Bradford Plumer, argue against the Electoral College due to potential issues such as "faithless" electors and the disaster factor, it is essential to acknowledge that such instances have been rare throughout history (Plumer, 11). The practical benefits of the Electoral College, including its role in ensuring stability, regional representation, and engagement of voters in swing states, outweigh these concerns.

In conclusion, the Electoral College remains a vital and effective component of the American electoral system. Its historical significance, coupled with the practical advantages it offers, makes a compelling case for its retention. Rather than discarding a system deeply ingrained in the nation's history, it is prudent to recognize its strengths and work towards refining and improving it for the benefit of the American democracy.

# What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register

1 The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

2 The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

3 The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . .

4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word “state” also refers to the District of Columbia.

5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate’s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .

6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state’s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate’s electors.

7 Most states have a “winner-take-all” system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of “proportional representation.” . . .

8 After the presidential election, your governor prepares a “Certificate of Ascertainment” listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state’s Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer

9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college

10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?

12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .

14 It’s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It’s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

# In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner

15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you’re actually voting for a slate of electors.

16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party’s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed) . . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons.

1) Certainty of Outcome

18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible—--it happened in 2000--—but it’s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012’s election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes—--538—--is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . .

2) Everyone’s President

19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised—to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn’t their president.

 3) Swing States

20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.

So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .

For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

The Electoral College, as enshrined in the Constitution by the founding fathers, stands as a testament to the delicate compromise struck between the election of the President by Congress and by a direct popular vote. While calls for its abolition have gained traction, it is essential to recognize the merits of the Electoral College and carefully consider the consequences of a shift to a popular vote system.

One of the primary virtues of the Electoral College, outlined by the Office of the Federal Register, is its role in balancing the interests of both federal and state entities. The allocation of electors based on Congressional representation ensures that smaller states are not overshadowed by larger ones, preserving a fair and equitable representation for all citizens (Federal Register, 1).

Judge Richard A. Posner offers a compelling argument in favor of the Electoral College, emphasizing the certainty of outcome it provides. The winner-take-all system in most states minimizes the chances of disputed election results, as the victorious candidate's electoral vote share tends to exceed their share of the popular vote (Posner, 18). This stability is crucial for the legitimacy and functioning of the electoral process.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal, preventing them from concentrating solely on densely populated areas. This ensures that candidates take into account the diverse interests of citizens across the nation, maintaining a more balanced and representative approach to governance (Posner, 19).

While critics, as voiced by Bradford Plumer, raise concerns about potential issues such as "faithless" electors and the disaster factor, it is vital to acknowledge that such instances have been infrequent throughout history (Plumer, 11). The disaster scenarios outlined, such as a tie in the electoral vote, are rare and, with proper attention, can be addressed without dismantling the entire system.

The Electoral College, despite its imperfections, has practical advantages that should not be dismissed. The winner-take-all method encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on toss-up states, fostering a more informed and engaged electorate (Posner, 20). This system encourages candidates to consider the concerns of citizens in all regions, preventing the marginalization of specific areas and ensuring a more inclusive governance model.

In conclusion, the Electoral College remains a crucial component of the American electoral system. Its historical significance, coupled with the practical advantages it offers, makes a compelling case for its retention. Rather than discarding a system deeply ingrained in the nation's history, it is prudent to recognize its strengths and work towards refining and improving it for the benefit of American democracy. The Electoral College strikes a delicate balance, ensuring fair representation, stability, and the consideration of diverse interests in the presidential election process.

Dear Senator,

The Electoral College has been a cornerstone of the American electoral system since its inception, and its merits remain relevant today. The Office of the Federal Register highlights the Electoral College's role as a compromise between direct congressional election and a popular vote, providing a balanced approach to representing both federal and state interests (Federal Register, 1). This foundational compromise ensures that smaller states are not marginalized, maintaining equitable representation for all citizens.

Critics, as outlined by Bradford Plumer, argue for the abolition of the Electoral College based on past controversies and its perceived unfairness (Plumer, 13). While concerns about "faithless" electors and potential ties in electoral votes are valid, it's crucial to recognize that such occurrences have been infrequent and can be addressed without abandoning the entire system (Plumer, 11-12).

Judge Richard A. Posner underscores the certainty of outcome provided by the Electoral College, reducing the likelihood of disputed election results compared to a popular vote (Posner, 18). The winner-take-all system ensures that the winning candidate's electoral vote share typically exceeds their share of the popular vote, minimizing the potential for contentious disputes (Posner, 18).

Moreover, the Electoral College encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal, preventing them from focusing solely on densely populated areas. This ensures a more balanced consideration of diverse regional interests and promotes inclusive governance (Posner, 19).

The focus on swing states, as supported by Posner, is an essential feature of the Electoral College. The winner-take-all method encourages candidates to concentrate their efforts on states where the outcome is uncertain, fostering a more informed and engaged electorate (Posner, 20). This ensures that voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and make thoughtful, informed decisions.

While critics argue that the Electoral College is unfair to voters, it's important to recognize that the system prevents candidates from concentrating solely on states where they have a clear advantage. This ensures a more widespread and inclusive approach to campaigning, preventing the marginalization of certain regions (Posner, 20).

In conclusion, the Electoral College, despite its imperfections, plays a crucial role in maintaining a balanced and representative electoral process. Rather than dismissing it outright, efforts should be directed towards refining and improving the system. The Electoral College's historical significance, coupled with its practical advantages, makes a compelling case for its retention. It provides stability, ensures equitable representation, and encourages candidates to consider the diverse interests of citizens across the nation.

# What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register

1 The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

2 The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

3 The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . .

4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word “state” also refers to the District of Columbia.

5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate’s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .

6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state’s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate’s electors.

7 Most states have a “winner-take-all” system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of “proportional representation.” . . .

8 After the presidential election, your governor prepares a “Certificate of Ascertainment” listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state’s Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer

9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college

10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?

12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .

14 It’s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It’s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

# In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner

15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you’re actually voting for a slate of electors.

16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party’s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed) . . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons.

1) Certainty of Outcome

18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible—--it happened in 2000--—but it’s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012’s election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes—--538—--is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . .

2) Everyone’s President

19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised—to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn’t their president.

 3) Swing States

20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.
4) Big States

21 The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .

5) Avoid Run-Off Elections

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

The Electoral College, established by the founding fathers as a compromise in the Constitution, continues to be a vital and effective component of the American electoral system. While critics, such as Bradford Plumer, argue for its abolition due to perceived flaws, it is essential to consider the nuanced advantages and historical context outlined by the Office of the Federal Register and Judge Richard A. Posner.

One of the primary virtues of the Electoral College, as highlighted by the Federal Register, is its role as a compromise, striking a balance between direct congressional election and a popular vote (Federal Register, 1). This compromise ensures that both federal and state interests are represented, preventing the marginalization of smaller states and fostering a more balanced system.

Posner emphasizes the certainty of outcome provided by the Electoral College, mitigating the likelihood of disputed election results compared to a popular vote (Posner, 18). The winner-take-all system ensures that the winning candidate's electoral vote share typically exceeds their share of the popular vote, reducing the potential for contentious disputes (Posner, 18).

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes candidates with trans-regional appeal, preventing them from focusing solely on densely populated areas. This ensures a more inclusive consideration of diverse regional interests and discourages candidates with only regional appeal from dominating the political landscape (Posner, 19).

The focus on swing states, as supported by Posner, is a critical feature of the Electoral College. The winner-take-all method encourages candidates to concentrate their efforts on states where the outcome is uncertain, fostering a more informed and engaged electorate (Posner, 20). This ensures that voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and make thoughtful, informed decisions.

While critics argue that the Electoral College is unfair to voters, it's crucial to recognize that the system prevents candidates from concentrating solely on states where they have a clear advantage. This ensures a more widespread and inclusive approach to campaigning, preventing the marginalization of certain regions (Posner, 20).

In conclusion, the Electoral College, with its historical significance and nuanced advantages, remains a crucial element of the American electoral system. Rather than discarding it outright, efforts should be directed towards refining and improving the system. The Electoral College provides stability, ensures equitable representation, and encourages candidates to consider the diverse interests of citizens across the nation. The focus should be on refining and strengthening the Electoral College rather than dismissing a system deeply ingrained in the nation's history.

Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my support for retaining the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. While critics argue for its abolition, citing concerns about fairness and potential issues, it is crucial to consider the nuanced advantages highlighted by various sources, including the Office of the Federal Register and Judge Richard A. Posner.

The Electoral College, as explained by the Federal Register, was established as a compromise between direct congressional election and a popular vote, ensuring a balanced representation of federal and state interests (Federal Register, 1). This compromise remains relevant today, preventing the domination of densely populated areas and fostering a more inclusive system.

Critics, such as Bradford Plumer, point out flaws in the Electoral College, emphasizing the potential for elector confusion and the so-called "disaster factor" (Plumer, 10-11). However, Judge Posner provides a more balanced perspective, outlining practical reasons for retaining the Electoral College, including the certainty of outcome and the avoidance of runoff elections (Posner, 18, 22).

The certainty of outcome, as argued by Posner, is a crucial advantage of the Electoral College. The winner-take-all system ensures that the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote typically exceeds their share of the popular vote, reducing the likelihood of disputed election results (Posner, 18). This certainty is essential for maintaining the stability and integrity of the electoral process.

Posner also highlights the Electoral College's role in fostering trans-regional appeal for presidential candidates, preventing candidates with only regional support from dominating the political landscape (Posner, 19). This ensures that the President represents a broader range of interests, preventing the marginalization of certain regions.

The focus on swing states, another point emphasized by Posner, is a critical aspect of the Electoral College. The winner-take-all method encourages candidates to concentrate their efforts on states where the outcome is uncertain, fostering a more informed and engaged electorate (Posner, 20). This ensures that voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and make thoughtful, informed decisions.

In conclusion, while the critics present valid concerns, it is essential to acknowledge the nuanced advantages of the Electoral College. The system maintains stability, prevents the domination of densely populated areas, and encourages candidates to consider the diverse interests of citizens across the nation. Rather than abolishing the Electoral College, efforts should be directed towards refining and strengthening the system to address its perceived shortcomings.

Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?

12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .

14 It’s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It’s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

# In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner

15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you’re actually voting for a slate of electors.

16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party’s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed) . . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons.

1) Certainty of Outcome

18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible—--it happened in 2000--—but it’s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012’s election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes—--538—--is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . .

2) Everyone’s President

19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised—to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn’t their president.

 3) Swing States

20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.
4) Big States

21 The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .

5) Avoid Run-Off Elections

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

The debate over whether to keep the Electoral College or transition to a popular vote system for electing the President of the United States has been ongoing, with strong arguments on both sides. While critics, as exemplified by Bradford Plumer, argue that the Electoral College is outdated and poses significant risks, proponents like Judge Richard A. Posner present practical reasons for its retention.

One of the primary arguments in favor of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. As outlined by Posner, this system minimizes the likelihood of election disputes, as the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote typically exceeds their share of the popular vote (Posner, 18). This inherent feature of the Electoral College contributes to the stability of the electoral process, preventing prolonged disputes over election results.

Posner also emphasizes the importance of trans-regional appeal, arguing that the Electoral College ensures that a presidential candidate must appeal to a broad range of regions rather than focusing solely on specific areas with higher populations (Posner, 19). This prevents candidates with only regional support from dominating the political landscape, fostering a more inclusive representation of diverse interests across the nation.

The focus on swing states is another advantage highlighted by Posner, asserting that the winner-take-all method encourages candidates to concentrate their efforts on states where the outcome is uncertain (Posner, 20). This dynamic prompts a more engaged and informed electorate in toss-up states, as voters become pivotal in deciding the election outcome.

Additionally, the Electoral College restores some balance to the political influence of large states, as argued by Posner. In a popular vote system, candidates might prioritize campaigning in densely populated areas, potentially neglecting the interests of citizens in less populous regions. The Electoral College ensures that both large and small states receive attention during campaigns, preventing the marginalization of certain regions (Posner, 21).

Furthermore, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections, a point highlighted by Posner. In situations where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, run-off elections could complicate the electoral process. The Electoral College provides a clear winner and reduces the pressure for additional elections, streamlining the presidential election process (Posner, 22).

While critics, as presented by Bradford Plumer, highlight potential flaws in the Electoral College, it is crucial to consider the nuanced advantages outlined by Posner. The system's ability to ensure a stable outcome, foster trans-regional appeal, focus on swing states, balance the influence of large states, and avoid run-off elections contributes to its continued relevance and effectiveness. Rather than abandoning the Electoral College entirely, efforts should be directed towards addressing specific concerns and refining the system for the modern era.

# What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register

1 The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

2 The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

3 The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . .

4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word “state” also refers to the District of Columbia.

5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate’s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .

6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state’s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate’s electors.

7 Most states have a “winner-take-all” system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of “proportional representation.” . . .

8 After the presidential election, your governor prepares a “Certificate of Ascertainment” listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state’s Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer

9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college

10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?

Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

The ongoing debate surrounding the Electoral College and the possibility of transitioning to a popular vote system for electing the President of the United States has elicited passionate arguments from both proponents and critics. As a concerned citizen, I am writing to express my support for the retention of the Electoral College, acknowledging the insights provided by the Office of the Federal Register and Judge Richard A. Posner.

The Electoral College, as elucidated by the Office of the Federal Register, was established as a compromise by the founding fathers, striking a balance between a direct vote in Congress and a popular vote by citizens (Office of the Federal Register, 1). This nuanced system comprises a series of steps, including the selection of electors, their meeting to vote for the President and Vice President, and the subsequent counting of electoral votes by Congress (Office of the Federal Register, 2). It involves 538 electors, with a majority of 270 electoral votes required to elect the President, and each state's allotment based on its Congressional delegation (Office of the Federal Register, 3). This intricate design reflects the framers' intent to ensure a representative and measured approach to electing the nation's leader.

While critics, such as Bradford Plumer, raise valid concerns about potential issues with the Electoral College, it is crucial to consider the practical reasons for retaining this system, as presented by Judge Richard A. Posner. Posner contends that the certainty of outcome, the requirement for trans-regional appeal, the focus on swing states, the balancing of political influence among big and small states, and the avoidance of run-off elections are compelling reasons to maintain the Electoral College (Posner, 17-22).

One crucial aspect Posner emphasizes is the certainty of outcome, asserting that disputes over the Electoral College results are less likely than disputes over the popular vote (Posner, 18). The winner-take-all method in most states creates a clear electoral-vote victory and minimizes the potential for prolonged conflicts over election results.

Moreover, Posner argues that the Electoral College encourages presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal, preventing candidates from focusing solely on densely populated areas and neglecting the interests of citizens in less populous regions (Posner, 19). This ensures a more inclusive representation of diverse regional perspectives in the presidential election process.

The emphasis on swing states, according to Posner, fosters an engaged and informed electorate, as voters in toss-up states play a pivotal role in deciding the election outcome (Posner, 20). This dynamic encourages thoughtful voter participation and a more nuanced understanding of the candidates' positions.

Additionally, the Electoral College addresses the political imbalance between large and small states, providing both with attention during campaigns and preventing the marginalization of certain regions (Posner, 21). This ensures that the interests of citizens across the nation are considered during the election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College's ability to avoid run-off elections simplifies the presidential election process, as it consistently produces a clear winner and reduces the pressure for additional elections (Posner, 22). This contributes to the stability and efficiency of the electoral system.

In conclusion, while the Electoral College may have its critics, the practical reasons for retaining it, as outlined by Judge Richard A. Posner, demonstrate its effectiveness in ensuring a representative, stable, and inclusive presidential election process. As your constituent, I urge you to consider these insights when weighing the future of our electoral system.

19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised—to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn’t their president.

 3) Swing States

20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.
4) Big States

21 The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .

5) Avoid Run-Off Elections

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

The debate over whether to retain the Electoral College or transition to a popular vote system for electing the President of the United States is a contentious and complex issue. As a concerned citizen, I advocate for maintaining the Electoral College, considering both the insights from the Office of the Federal Register and the compelling arguments presented by Judge Richard A. Posner.

The Electoral College, as described by the Office of the Federal Register, represents a compromise embedded in the Constitution to balance the methods of electing the President—between a direct vote in Congress and a popular vote by qualified citizens (Office of the Federal Register, 1). The multistep process involving the selection of electors, their voting for the President and Vice President, and the subsequent counting of electoral votes by Congress is a carefully crafted system aimed at providing a representative and measured approach to electing the nation's leader (Office of the Federal Register, 2).

While critics like Bradford Plumer highlight concerns such as the "disaster factor" and the potential for a tie in the electoral vote, the practical reasons presented by Judge Richard A. Posner provide a compelling case for the retention of the Electoral College (Plumer, 11-13; Posner, 17-22).

Posner argues for the "Certainty of Outcome," asserting that disputes over the Electoral College results are less likely than disputes over the popular vote, given that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote (Posner, 18). This certainty minimizes the chances of prolonged conflicts over election results.

The Electoral College encourages presidential candidates to have "trans-regional appeal," preventing candidates from focusing solely on densely populated areas and neglecting the interests of citizens in less populous regions (Posner, 19). This fosters a more inclusive representation of diverse regional perspectives in the presidential election process.

Posner also emphasizes the importance of "Swing States," arguing that the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces candidates to focus their campaign efforts on toss-up states, fostering an engaged and informed electorate (Posner, 20). This dynamic encourages thoughtful voter participation and a more nuanced understanding of the candidates' positions.

Furthermore, the Electoral College addresses the political imbalance between "Big States" and small states, ensuring that both receive attention during campaigns and preventing the marginalization of certain regions (Posner, 21). This ensures that the interests of citizens across the nation are considered during the election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College's ability to avoid run-off elections simplifies the presidential election process, as it consistently produces a clear winner and reduces the pressure for additional elections (Posner, 22). This contributes to the stability and efficiency of the electoral system.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, despite its critics, plays a crucial role in maintaining a representative, stable, and inclusive presidential election process. As your constituent, I encourage you to consider these practical reasons when evaluating the future of our electoral system.

# What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register

1 The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

2 The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

3 The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . .

4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word “state” also refers to the District of Columbia.

5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate’s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .

6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state’s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate’s electors.

7 Most states have a “winner-take-all” system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of “proportional representation.” . . .

8 After the presidential election, your governor prepares a “Certificate of Ascertainment” listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state’s Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer

9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college

10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?

12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .

14 It’s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It’s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

# In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner

15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you’re actually voting for a slate of electors.

16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party’s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed) . . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons.

1) Certainty of Outcome

18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible—--it happened in 2000--—but it’s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012’s election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes—--538—--is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . .

2) Everyone’s President

19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president.

The Electoral College, as established by the Founding Fathers in the Constitution, has been a subject of heated debate in recent years. While critics, as exemplified by Bradford Plumer, argue against it, defenders like Judge Richard A. Posner provide practical reasons for its retention. As a concerned citizen, I contend that maintaining the Electoral College is essential for preserving the stability, representation, and inclusivity of the presidential election process.

One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College, highlighted by Posner, is the "Certainty of Outcome" (Posner, 18). Unlike a popular vote system that could lead to disputes and recounts, the Electoral College typically results in a clear winner, reducing the likelihood of extended conflicts over election results. This certainty is crucial for maintaining public trust in the democratic process.

Critics, including Plumer, argue against the Electoral College by emphasizing its potential for disaster, citing historical instances where electors defied the will of the people or the possibility of a tie in the electoral vote (Plumer, 11-12). However, these scenarios are infrequent, and the Electoral College provides a structured mechanism for resolving such situations, ensuring a final and decisive outcome.

Posner's argument regarding the need for a candidate to have "trans-regional appeal" is another compelling reason to support the Electoral College (Posner, 19). By requiring candidates to appeal to a broad cross-section of the nation, this system discourages candidates from focusing solely on densely populated urban areas, ensuring that the interests of citizens from various regions are considered during campaigns.

The importance of "Swing States," as Posner emphasizes, is an additional strength of the Electoral College (Posner, 20). The winner-take-all approach encourages candidates to engage with voters in closely contested states, fostering an informed and engaged electorate. This ensures that citizens in these states, often considered representative of diverse perspectives, play a significant role in deciding the outcome of the election.

Furthermore, the Electoral College addresses the imbalance between "Big States" and small states, preventing the marginalization of less populous regions (Posner, 21). This ensures that candidates need to consider the interests of citizens across the entire nation, promoting a more inclusive and representative democracy.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections, as highlighted by Posner (Posner, 22). This helps streamline the presidential election process, ensuring a clear winner and reducing the complexities associated with run-off elections.

While critics argue that the Electoral College may disenfranchise voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, the reality is that voter turnout remains substantial, indicating that citizens are motivated to express their political preferences regardless of the election system (Posner, 23).

In conclusion, the Electoral College, with its structured and representative approach to electing the President, remains a vital component of the American democratic system. While acknowledging the concerns raised by critics, the practical reasons provided by defenders underscore the system's effectiveness in maintaining stability, promoting representation, and fostering an inclusive electoral process. As your constituent, I urge you to consider these factors when deliberating on the future of our nation's electoral system.

Posner's argument about the importance of a candidate having "trans-regional appeal" is another compelling reason to support the Electoral College (Posner, 19). By requiring candidates to appeal to a broad cross-section of the nation, this system discourages candidates from focusing solely on densely populated urban areas, ensuring that the interests of citizens from various regions are considered during campaigns.

The significance of "Swing States," as Posner emphasizes, is an additional strength of the Electoral College (Posner, 20). The winner-take-all approach encourages candidates to engage with voters in closely contested states, fostering an informed and engaged electorate. This ensures that citizens in these states, often considered representative of diverse perspectives, play a significant role in deciding the outcome of the election.

Furthermore, the Electoral College addresses the imbalance between "Big States" and small states, preventing the marginalization of less populous regions (Posner, 21). This ensures that candidates need to consider the interests of citizens across the entire nation, promoting a more inclusive and representative democracy.

The Electoral College also helps avoid the need for run-off elections, as highlighted by Posner (Posner, 22). This streamlines the presidential election process, ensuring a clear winner and reducing the complexities associated with run-off elections.

While critics argue that the Electoral College may disenfranchise voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, the reality is that voter turnout remains substantial, indicating that citizens are motivated to express their political preferences regardless of the election system (Posner, 23).

In conclusion, the Electoral College, with its structured and representative approach to electing the President, remains a vital component of the American democratic system. While acknowledging the concerns raised by critics, the practical reasons provided by defenders underscore the system's effectiveness in maintaining stability, promoting representation, and fostering an inclusive electoral process. As your constituent, I urge you to consider these factors when deliberating on the future of our nation's electoral system.

# What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register

1 The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

2 The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

3 The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . .

4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word “state” also refers to the District of Columbia.

5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate’s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .

6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state’s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate’s electors.

7 Most states have a “winner-take-all” system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of “proportional representation.” . . .

8 After the presidential election, your governor prepares a “Certificate of Ascertainment” listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state’s Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer

9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college

10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?

12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .

14 It’s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It’s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

# In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner

15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you’re actually voting for a slate of electors.

16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party’s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed) . . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons.

1) Certainty of Outcome

18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible—--it happened in 2000--—but it’s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012’s election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes—--538—--is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . .

2) Everyone’s President

19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised—to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn’t their president.

 3) Swing States

20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.
4) Big States

21 The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .

5) Avoid Run-Off Elections

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

The debate surrounding the Electoral College versus a direct popular vote for the President of the United States has been a longstanding and contentious issue. While critics argue that the Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system, defenders assert that it serves essential purposes for the stability and representation of our nation. In examining these arguments, it becomes evident that the Electoral College, despite its flaws, remains a crucial component of the American democratic process.

Critics of the Electoral College, as highlighted in Bradford Plumer's essay, emphasize its potential for disaster, citing instances of electors defying the popular vote and the prospect of an electoral tie (Plumer, 11-12). While these concerns are valid, they represent rare occurrences that can be addressed within the existing framework. Plumer's assertion that the Electoral College is unfair to voters due to the winner-take-all system in each state is countered by the defenders' claim that it ensures the certainty of outcome, reducing the likelihood of disputes over the popular vote (Posner, 18).

Judge Richard A. Posner provides practical reasons for retaining the Electoral College, focusing on its positive aspects. The requirement for a presidential candidate to have "trans-regional appeal" ensures that candidates consider the interests of citizens across diverse regions (Posner, 19). This prevents candidates from focusing solely on densely populated urban areas, promoting a more inclusive representation of the nation.

The emphasis on "Swing States" in Posner's defense acknowledges that the winner-take-all method induces candidates to focus on closely contested states, encouraging a more engaged and informed electorate (Posner, 20). This aspect fosters a thoughtful voter base, as citizens in toss-up states become key decision-makers, influencing the outcome of the election.

Posner's argument regarding the importance of "Big States" addresses the balance in political influence, ensuring that large states receive attention during campaigns (Posner, 21). This counters the criticism that the Electoral College marginalizes less populous states, providing a mechanism to restore political balance.

Moreover, the Electoral College serves the practical purpose of avoiding run-off elections, streamlining the electoral process and providing a clear winner without the need for additional rounds of voting (Posner, 22). This pragmatic approach reduces the complexity associated with run-off elections and ensures a decisive outcome.

While critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, Posner contends that voters in presidential elections express political preferences rather than believing a single vote may decide the election (Posner, 23). This challenges the notion that the Electoral College diminishes voter engagement and underscores the resilience of voter turnout.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, despite its imperfections, plays a crucial role in ensuring stability, representation, and inclusivity in the American democratic process. While acknowledging the concerns raised by critics, the practical reasons presented by defenders underscore the system's effectiveness. As your constituent, I urge you to consider these factors when evaluating the ongoing debate over the Electoral College and its role in our nation's electoral system.

The debate surrounding the Electoral College versus a direct popular vote for the President of the United States has been a longstanding and contentious issue. Advocates for the Electoral College, as outlined in the text by the Office of the Federal Register, argue that it serves as a compromise that ensures representation from all states and prevents densely populated urban areas from dominating the electoral process. The Electoral College, established by the founding fathers, consists of 538 electors, with a majority of 270 electoral votes required to elect the President. Each state's allotment of electors is based on its Congressional delegation, providing a balance between the interests of large and small states (Office of the Federal Register, 1-3).

While critics, as highlighted in Bradford Plumer's essay, argue that the Electoral College is flawed and undemocratic, it is essential to consider the practical reasons presented by defenders, as articulated by Judge Richard A. Posner. Posner emphasizes the certainty of outcome in the Electoral College, reducing the likelihood of disputes over the popular vote, which can be a significant concern in a closely contested election (Posner, 18).

Posner further argues that the Electoral College ensures that presidential candidates have trans-regional appeal, preventing candidates with only regional support from winning the presidency. This prevents candidates from focusing solely on specific regions, fostering a more inclusive representation of the nation (Posner, 19). The emphasis on swing states in Posner's defense acknowledges that the winner-take-all method induces candidates to focus on closely contested states, encouraging a more engaged and informed electorate (Posner, 20).

The Electoral College, according to Posner, also restores political balance by giving attention to large states that might otherwise be marginalized due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. This is essential in maintaining fairness and preventing the dominance of smaller states or densely populated regions in the presidential election process (Posner, 21).

Additionally, the Electoral College avoids the problem of run-off elections, providing a clear winner without the need for additional rounds of voting. This practical advantage streamlines the electoral process, reducing the complexity associated with run-off elections (Posner, 22).

Critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning. However, Posner contends that voters in presidential elections are more interested in expressing a political preference than believing a single vote may decide an election. The high voter turnout in the 2012 election despite this argument supports Posner's perspective (Posner, 23).

In conclusion, the Electoral College, while facing criticism, serves practical purposes that contribute to the stability, representation, and inclusivity of the American democratic process.

8 After the presidential election, your governor prepares a “Certificate of Ascertainment” listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state’s Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer

9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college

10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?

12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .

14 It’s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It’s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

# In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner

15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you’re actually voting for a slate of electors.

16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party’s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed) . . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons.

1) Certainty of Outcome

18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible—--it happened in 2000--—but it’s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012’s election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes—--538—--is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . .

2) Everyone’s President

19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised—to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn’t their president.

 3) Swing States

20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.
4) Big States

21 The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .

5) Avoid Run-Off Elections

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

The ongoing debate over the Electoral College versus a direct popular vote for the President of the United States is a complex issue that demands careful consideration of both sides. As a concerned citizen, I advocate for the retention of the Electoral College, acknowledging the criticisms raised by its opponents while highlighting the practical reasons presented by its defenders, as outlined in the texts by the Office of the Federal Register and Judge Richard A. Posner.

Critics of the Electoral College, as voiced in Bradford Plumer's essay, emphasize its flaws, including the potential for "faithless" electors, the risk of a tie in the electoral vote, and the winner-take-all system that they argue is unfair to voters. Plumer contends that the system can lead to a concentration of campaign efforts in a few swing states, leaving voters in non-competitive states overlooked and underrepresented (Plumer, 10-14). These concerns are valid and underscore the need for a thorough examination of the Electoral College system.

However, Judge Posner provides a compelling defense of the Electoral College by presenting practical reasons for its retention. Posner argues that the certainty of outcome in the Electoral College reduces the likelihood of disputes over the popular vote, as the winning candidate's share of electoral votes usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This, he claims, makes disputes less likely than in a direct popular vote (Posner, 18).

Furthermore, Posner contends that the Electoral College ensures that presidential candidates must have trans-regional appeal, preventing candidates with only regional support from winning the presidency. This regional inclusivity, he argues, fosters a more representative outcome and prevents the concentration of power in specific regions (Posner, 19).

Posner also highlights the significance of swing states, asserting that the winner-take-all method induces candidates to focus their campaigns on toss-up states. This, he argues, encourages an engaged and informed electorate in those states, contributing to a more thoughtful voter base (Posner, 20).

The Electoral College, according to Posner, restores political balance by giving attention to large states that might otherwise be marginalized due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. This ensures that candidates address the concerns of citizens in both large and small states, contributing to a more inclusive representation (Posner, 21).

Lastly, Posner argues that the Electoral College avoids the complications of run-off elections, providing a clear winner without the need for additional rounds of voting. This practical advantage streamlines the electoral process, reducing the complexity associated with run-off elections (Posner, 22).

While critics rightly point out flaws in the Electoral College system, the practical reasons articulated by Posner offer a compelling argument for its retention. The system, with its checks and balances, regional inclusivity, and prevention of run-off elections, plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability and fairness of the presidential election process. As your constituent, I urge you to carefully consider these practical reasons when evaluating any proposed changes to our nation's electoral system.

# What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register

1 The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

2 The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

3 The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . .

4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word “state” also refers to the District of Columbia.

5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate’s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .

6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state’s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate’s electors.

The ongoing debate surrounding the Electoral College versus a direct popular vote for the President of the United States is a critical issue that demands thoughtful consideration. As a concerned citizen, I argue in favor of retaining the Electoral College due to its practical advantages, as highlighted by Judge Richard A. Posner. While critics like Bradford Plumer point out legitimate concerns, including the potential for "faithless" electors, disputes over the popular vote, and concentration of campaigns in swing states, Posner provides compelling reasons to maintain the current system.

One of the practical advantages of the Electoral College, as outlined by Posner, is the certainty of outcome. Despite disputes over the popular vote, the winner of the Electoral College invariably has a clear majority. In the 2012 election, for instance, President Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of the popular votes, demonstrating that the system provides a decisive outcome and reduces the likelihood of prolonged disputes (Posner, 18).

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that presidential candidates must have trans-regional appeal, preventing candidates with only regional support from winning the presidency. This inclusivity fosters a more representative outcome and prevents the concentration of power in specific regions, addressing concerns about regional disparities in influence (Posner, 19).

Posner also emphasizes the significance of swing states, arguing that the winner-take-all method induces candidates to focus their campaigns on toss-up states. This encourages an engaged and informed electorate in those states, contributing to a more thoughtful voter base. In contrast, a direct popular vote might lead candidates to prioritize populous regions, neglecting the concerns of citizens in less densely populated areas (Posner, 20).

Another crucial point Posner raises is that the Electoral College restores political balance by giving attention to large states that might otherwise be marginalized due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. This ensures that candidates address the concerns of citizens in both large and small states, contributing to a more inclusive representation (Posner, 21).

Lastly, Posner argues that the Electoral College avoids the complications of run-off elections, providing a clear winner without the need for additional rounds of voting. This practical advantage streamlines the electoral process, reducing the complexity associated with run-off elections and ensuring an efficient outcome (Posner, 22).

While critics like Plumer raise valid concerns about the Electoral College, the practical advantages outlined by Posner provide a strong case for its retention. The system's ability to deliver a decisive outcome, promote trans-regional appeal, and prevent the marginalization of certain states underscores its importance in maintaining a fair and representative presidential election process. As your constituent, I urge you to consider these practical advantages when evaluating any proposals to alter our nation's electoral system.

During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .

14 It’s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It’s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

# In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner

15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you’re actually voting for a slate of electors.

16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party’s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed) . . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons.

1) Certainty of Outcome

18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible—--it happened in 2000--—but it’s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012’s election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes—--538—--is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . .

2) Everyone’s President

19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised—to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn’t their president.

 3) Swing States

20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.
4) Big States

21 The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .

5) Avoid Run-Off Elections

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

Dear Senator,

The debate over the Electoral College versus a direct popular vote for the President of the United States is a complex issue that requires careful consideration. After reviewing multiple perspectives, I advocate for the retention of the Electoral College, as it offers practical advantages that contribute to a fair and representative presidential election process.

One of the key benefits of the Electoral College, as argued by Judge Richard A. Posner, is the certainty of outcome. Despite occasional disputes, the Electoral College consistently produces a decisive winner. In the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of the popular votes, highlighting the system's ability to provide a clear and unambiguous outcome (Posner, 18).

Additionally, the Electoral College fosters trans-regional appeal, ensuring that presidential candidates must address the concerns of citizens across various regions. Without this requirement, candidates might concentrate solely on populous regions, neglecting the interests of citizens in less densely populated areas. This inclusivity promotes a more representative presidency (Posner, 19).

The focus on swing states is another advantage Posner highlights. The winner-take-all method encourages candidates to engage with voters in toss-up states, fostering a more informed and thoughtful electorate. Direct popular vote systems might lead to a concentration of campaign efforts in densely populated areas, leaving citizens in other regions feeling disenfranchised (Posner, 20).

Moreover, the Electoral College restores balance to the political influence of large states, addressing concerns related to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. By ensuring that large states receive more attention from candidates, the Electoral College contributes to a more inclusive representation of the diverse needs and opinions across the nation (Posner, 21).

The avoidance of run-off elections is another practical advantage of the Electoral College. This system eliminates the need for additional rounds of voting when no candidate secures a majority, streamlining the election process and preventing unnecessary complications (Posner, 22).

While critics, such as Bradford Plumer, raise valid concerns about the Electoral College, including the potential for "faithless" electors and concentration of campaigns in swing states, the practical advantages outlined by Posner provide a compelling case for its retention. The system's ability to deliver a decisive outcome, promote trans-regional appeal, and prevent the marginalization of certain states underscores its importance in maintaining a fair and representative presidential election process.

In conclusion, as your constituent, I urge you to consider these practical advantages when evaluating any proposals to alter our nation's electoral system. The Electoral College, with its inherent safeguards and benefits, plays a crucial role in ensuring a fair and inclusive representation of the diverse voices within our nation.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

# What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register

1 The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

2 The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

3 The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . .

4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word “state” also refers to the District of Columbia.

5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate’s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .

6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state’s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate’s electors.

7 Most states have a “winner-take-all” system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of “proportional representation.” . . .

8 After the presidential election, your governor prepares a “Certificate of Ascertainment” listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state’s Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer

9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college

10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?

12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .

14 It’s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality.

The Electoral College has long been a subject of debate, with proponents and critics presenting compelling arguments. As a concerned citizen, I argue in favor of retaining the Electoral College, as it offers practical advantages that contribute to a fair and representative presidential election process.

One of the fundamental benefits of the Electoral College, as outlined by the Office of the Federal Register, is its role as a compromise between direct popular vote and congressional selection. This nuanced system ensures that the President is chosen through a thoughtful process, balancing the interests of individual citizens and states as a whole (Federal Register, 1).

Critics, such as Bradford Plumer, contend that the Electoral College is fraught with potential issues, including "faithless" electors and the possibility of a tie in the electoral vote. While these concerns are valid, they represent exceptional scenarios rather than inherent flaws in the system. The disaster factor, as described by Plumer, is not a frequent occurrence, and safeguards exist to address such situations (Plumer, 11-12).

Judge Richard A. Posner emphasizes the practical reasons for retaining the Electoral College, such as the certainty of outcome. The winner-take-all system ensures that the winning candidate's share of electoral votes usually exceeds their share of the popular vote, providing a decisive and unambiguous outcome (Posner, 18). This prevents prolonged disputes over election results, contributing to the stability of the democratic process.

The Electoral College's requirement for a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, as argued by Posner, is another crucial advantage. This ensures that candidates must consider the diverse needs and interests of citizens across various regions, promoting a more inclusive representation in the highest office (Posner, 19).

Additionally, the focus on swing states, as highlighted by Posner, encourages candidates to engage with a broader spectrum of voters. This system prevents campaigns from becoming excessively concentrated in densely populated areas, ensuring that citizens in various states have a voice in shaping the nation's leadership (Posner, 20).

The Electoral College also addresses the political imbalance resulting from the mal-apportionment of the Senate, offering large states a proportionate level of attention from presidential candidates. This balance contributes to a fair representation of the diverse opinions and needs of citizens across the nation (Posner, 21).

In conclusion, while critics like Plumer raise valid concerns, the Electoral College's practical advantages, as outlined by the Federal Register and Posner, make a compelling case for its retention. This system ensures a fair and inclusive representation of citizens' voices in the presidential election process, striking a balance between individual interests and the needs of the nation as a whole.

For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

The debate over the Electoral College remains a central issue in discussions about the American electoral system. While some argue for its abolition, citing issues of fairness and the potential for disasters like the 2000 election, I contend that the Electoral College should be retained due to its practical advantages, as highlighted by the Office of the Federal Register and Judge Richard A. Posner.

One of the primary benefits of the Electoral College is its role as a compromise, addressing concerns about the balance between a direct popular vote and congressional selection (Federal Register, 1). This nuanced approach ensures that both individual citizens and states as a whole are considered in the election process, preventing an overemphasis on densely populated regions.

Bradford Plumer raises valid concerns about potential issues within the Electoral College system, such as "faithless" electors and the possibility of a tie in the electoral vote. However, these concerns represent exceptional cases rather than inherent flaws in the system. Safeguards exist to address such situations, and the disaster factor, as highlighted by Plumer, is not a frequent occurrence (Plumer, 11-12).

Judge Richard A. Posner provides practical reasons for retaining the Electoral College, emphasizing the certainty of outcome and the prevention of disputes over the popular vote. The winner-take-all system ensures a decisive and unambiguous result, contributing to the stability of the democratic process (Posner, 18).

Moreover, the Electoral College's requirement for a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, as argued by Posner, ensures that candidates must consider the diverse needs and interests of citizens across various regions. This promotes a more inclusive representation in the highest office, preventing candidates from focusing solely on densely populated areas (Posner, 19).

The focus on swing states, as highlighted by Posner, encourages candidates to engage with a broader spectrum of voters, preventing campaigns from becoming excessively concentrated in particular regions. This ensures that citizens in various states have a voice in shaping the nation's leadership, fostering a more democratic and representative process (Posner, 20).

In conclusion, while critics like Plumer raise valid concerns, the practical advantages of the Electoral College, as outlined by the Federal Register and Posner, make a compelling case for its retention. This system ensures a fair and inclusive representation of citizens' voices in the presidential election process, striking a balance between individual interests and the needs of the nation as a whole. Calls for abolition should be carefully considered, taking into account the potential consequences on the democratic process and the representation of diverse voices.

# What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register

1 The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

2 The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

3 The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . .

4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word “state” also refers to the District of Columbia.

5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate’s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .

6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state’s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate’s electors.

7 Most states have a “winner-take-all” system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of “proportional representation.” . . .

8 After the presidential election, your governor prepares a “Certificate of Ascertainment” listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state’s Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer

9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college

10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?

12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .

14 It’s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It’s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

# In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner

15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you’re actually voting for a slate of electors.

16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party’s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed) . . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons.

1) Certainty of Outcome

18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible—--it happened in 2000--—but it’s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012’s election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes—--538—--is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . .

2) Everyone’s President

19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised—to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn’t their president.

 3) Swing States

20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.
4) Big States

21 The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .

5) Avoid Run-Off Elections

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

The debate over whether to keep the Electoral College or transition to a popular vote system for electing the President of the United States is a contentious issue that merits careful consideration. The Electoral College, established by the founding fathers as a compromise, has both staunch defenders and vocal critics. While some argue for its retention based on practical and historical reasons, others vehemently advocate for its abolition, pointing to perceived flaws and inequities. After examining the arguments from various perspectives, it becomes clear that maintaining the Electoral College is essential for ensuring a stable and representative presidential election process.

One of the primary arguments in favor of retaining the Electoral College, as articulated by Judge Richard A. Posner, is the certainty of outcome. The Electoral College system, by awarding electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis in most states, tends to produce a clear winner, reducing the likelihood of disputes over election results. In contrast, a direct popular vote system could lead to more contentious situations, especially in close elections, where disputes over the popular vote outcome might be more prevalent. The Electoral College, with its inherent structure, provides a level of stability that contributes to the overall integrity of the election process.

Another crucial aspect supporting the Electoral College is its ability to ensure that the President has trans-regional appeal, as argued by Judge Posner. The requirement for a candidate to garner electoral votes from various states prevents candidates from focusing solely on specific regions, fostering a more inclusive campaign strategy. This prevents candidates from neglecting the interests of voters in less populous states, ensuring a president with a broader understanding of and concern for the diverse needs of the entire nation.

Furthermore, the focus on swing states, as highlighted by Judge Posner, is a distinctive feature of the Electoral College that merits consideration. The winner-take-all method encourages candidates to concentrate their efforts on states where the election outcome is uncertain. This heightened attention to swing states ensures that voters in these states are more engaged and informed, as they play a pivotal role in determining the election outcome. A shift to a popular vote system might result in candidates neglecting states that are historically less competitive, leaving large portions of the population without a direct influence on the election.

Addressing the criticism of the Electoral College, Bradford Plumer contends that the system is flawed and outdated, citing examples of potential crises and unfairness. He points to instances of electors deviating from the popular vote and the possibility of a tie in the electoral vote, both of which could lead to chaotic scenarios. While these concerns are valid, proponents argue that these occurrences are rare and that the overall stability provided by the Electoral College outweighs the potential downsides.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, despite its imperfections, stands as a crucial element of the American electoral system. It ensures a stable and predictable outcome, prevents candidates from neglecting the interests of specific regions, and maintains focus on swing states, encouraging a more engaged electorate. While calls for its abolition persist, the practical reasons presented by Judge Posner make a compelling case for the retention of the Electoral College as the preferred method for selecting the President of the United States.

The Electoral College has been a cornerstone of the American electoral system since the nation's founding, playing a vital role in ensuring a stable and representative process for electing the President. While critics argue for its abolition, citing issues such as the potential for a mismatch between the electoral and popular vote and the risk of electoral ties, a closer examination reveals that the Electoral College remains a fundamental aspect of the democratic process.

One key advantage of the Electoral College, as emphasized by Judge Richard A. Posner, is the certainty of outcome. The winner-take-all system employed by most states reduces the likelihood of disputes over election results. In contrast, a direct popular vote system could lead to more contentious situations, especially in closely contested elections where disputes over the popular vote might be more prevalent. The Electoral College, with its built-in structure, provides a level of stability that contributes to the overall integrity of the election process.

Moreover, the Electoral College ensures that the President has trans-regional appeal, preventing candidates from focusing solely on specific regions, as Judge Posner argues. Requiring a candidate to garner electoral votes from various states fosters a more inclusive campaign strategy, preventing candidates from neglecting the interests of voters in less populous states. This ensures a president with a broader understanding of and concern for the diverse needs of the entire nation.

The focus on swing states, as outlined by Judge Posner, is another distinct advantage of the Electoral College.

While critics, such as Bradford Plumer, argue that the Electoral College is unfair and outdated, the practical reasons put forth by Judge Posner provide a compelling case for its retention. Plumer's concerns about potential crises and unfairness, while valid, are infrequent occurrences, and the overall stability provided by the Electoral College outweighs these potential downsides.

In conclusion, the Electoral College remains a crucial element of the American electoral system, ensuring stability, trans-regional appeal, and attention to swing states. While calls for its abolition persist, the practical reasons presented by Judge Posner make a strong case for the retention of the Electoral College as the preferred method for selecting the President of the United States. The system, though imperfect, continues to serve the nation well in maintaining a balanced and representative democracy.

Your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . .

4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word “state” also refers to the District of Columbia.

5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate’s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .

6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state’s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate’s electors.

7 Most states have a “winner-take-all” system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of “proportional representation.” . . .

8 After the presidential election, your governor prepares a “Certificate of Ascertainment” listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state’s Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer

9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college

10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?

12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .

14 It’s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It’s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

# In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner

15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you’re actually voting for a slate of electors.

16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party’s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed) . . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons.

1) Certainty of Outcome

18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible—--it happened in 2000--—but it’s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012’s election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes—--538—--is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . .

2) Everyone’s President

19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised—to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn’t their president.

 3) Swing States

20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.
4) Big States

21 The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .

5) Avoid Run-Off Elections

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

Dear [State Senator],

I am writing to express my support for the retention of the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. While the system may have its critics, it serves as a vital and time-tested component of our democratic process, addressing concerns related to the certainty of outcome, trans-regional appeal, and the role of swing states.

The certainty of outcome provided by the Electoral College is a crucial factor in maintaining the stability of our elections. As highlighted by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winner-take-all system reduces the likelihood of disputes over election results. In contrast, a direct popular vote system could lead to more contentious situations, especially in closely contested elections where disputes over the popular vote might be more prevalent. The Electoral College ensures a clear and indisputable winner, contributing to the overall integrity of the election process.

Additionally, the Electoral College requires presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal, preventing them from focusing solely on specific regions. This ensures a more inclusive campaign strategy, as candidates must garner support from various states to secure electoral votes. Without this requirement, there is a risk of neglecting the interests of voters in less populous states, leading to a less representative presidency. The Electoral College fosters a broader understanding of and concern for the diverse needs of the entire nation.

Furthermore, the focus on swing states, facilitated by the winner-take-all method, ensures that voters in these states play a pivotal role in determining the election outcome. This heightened attention to swing states encourages voters to be more engaged and informed, as they are aware of their decisive role. A shift to a popular vote system might result in candidates neglecting states that are historically less competitive, leaving large portions of the population without a direct influence on the election.

While critics argue that the Electoral College is unfair and outdated, it is essential to recognize the practical reasons for its retention, as presented by Judge Posner. The potential crises and concerns raised by critics, as mentioned by Bradford Plumer, are infrequent occurrences, and the overall stability provided by the Electoral College outweighs these potential downsides.

In conclusion, the Electoral College remains a crucial element of the American electoral system, ensuring stability, trans-regional appeal, and attention to swing states. It is my sincere hope that you will consider these factors in advocating for the retention of the Electoral College, preserving the integrity and fairness of our presidential elections.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

The question of whether to maintain the Electoral College or transition to a popular vote system for electing the President of the United States is a contentious issue that involves a careful examination of the advantages and disadvantages presented by various sources. While critics argue that the Electoral College is outdated and prone to potential crises, defenders posit practical reasons for its retention, emphasizing the certainty of outcome, trans-regional appeal, the importance of swing states, consideration of large states, and the avoidance of runoff elections.

One compelling argument in favor of retaining the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. As Judge Richard A. Posner contends, the winner-take-all system minimizes the likelihood of disputes over election results. This is due to the fact that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College typically exceeds their share of the popular vote, creating a clear and indisputable victor. In contrast, a direct popular vote system could result in more contentious situations, especially in closely contested elections where disputes over the popular vote might be more prevalent.

Moreover, defenders of the Electoral College stress the importance of trans-regional appeal, arguing that it prevents candidates from focusing solely on specific regions. This requirement encourages a more inclusive campaign strategy, as candidates must garner support from various states to secure electoral votes. In the absence of this system, there is a risk of neglecting the interests of voters in less populous states, potentially leading to a less representative presidency.

Additionally, the focus on swing states, facilitated by the winner-take-all method, is highlighted as a positive aspect of the Electoral College. This emphasis ensures that voters in these states play a pivotal role in determining the election outcome, fostering increased engagement and information retention among voters. The heightened attention to swing states encourages candidates to address a broader range of issues, resulting in a more thoughtful and comprehensive campaign.

However, critics of the Electoral College, as articulated by Bradford Plumer, raise valid concerns about its potential drawbacks. The disaster factor, as exemplified by the 2000 election, reveals vulnerabilities in the system that could lead to crises, such as state legislatures defying the will of the people or the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. These are valid concerns that necessitate a thoughtful examination of potential reforms.

In conclusion, the decision to retain the Electoral College or transition to a popular vote system requires a careful weighing of practical benefits and potential pitfalls. While the Electoral College ensures a certain outcome, encourages trans-regional appeal, and emphasizes the importance of swing states, critics rightly point out potential crises and unfairness in the system. A thorough evaluation of these factors is essential in determining the most effective and representative method for electing the President of the United States.

Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .

14 It’s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It’s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

# In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner

15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you’re actually voting for a slate of electors.

16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party’s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed) . . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons.

1) Certainty of Outcome

18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible—--it happened in 2000--—but it’s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012’s election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes—--538—--is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . .

2) Everyone’s President

19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised—to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn’t their president.

 3) Swing States

20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.
4) Big States

21 The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .

5) Avoid Run-Off Elections

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

The Electoral College, as established by the founding fathers in the Constitution, has been a cornerstone of the American electoral system. However, the debate over its relevance and efficacy persists. While some argue for its preservation, highlighting its role in ensuring a certainty of outcome, trans-regional appeal, emphasis on swing states, consideration of large states, and avoidance of runoff elections, others, like critics Bradford Plumer, advocate for its abolition, citing concerns about the potential for crises, unfairness to voters, and the undemocratic nature of the system.

One significant advantage of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. As Judge Richard A. Posner contends, this system reduces the likelihood of disputes over election results compared to a direct popular vote. The winner-take-all approach in most states creates a clear victor and minimizes the potential for contested outcomes. This ensures stability and confidence in the electoral process, avoiding the chaos that could arise from widespread disputes over the popular vote.

Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages candidates to develop trans-regional appeal, a vital aspect of effective presidential leadership. By requiring candidates to secure electoral votes across various states, this system prevents candidates from concentrating solely on regions where they are already popular. In doing so, it promotes a more inclusive campaign strategy and discourages candidates from neglecting the interests of voters in less populous states, fostering a presidency that is representative of the nation as a whole.

Additionally, the emphasis on swing states in the Electoral College process is a strategic advantage. According to Posner, this method ensures that voters in toss-up states play a decisive role in determining the election outcome. Candidates focus their efforts on these states, leading to a more engaged and informed electorate. This approach fosters a more thoughtful and comprehensive campaign, as candidates address a broader range of issues to appeal to these pivotal voters.

Despite these advantages, critics like Bradford Plumer raise legitimate concerns about the Electoral College, particularly regarding potential crises and fairness to voters. The disaster factor, as demonstrated in the 2000 election, reveals vulnerabilities in the system, such as state legislatures potentially defying the will of the people or the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. These issues underscore the need for careful consideration and potential reforms to address the flaws in the current system.

In conclusion, the debate over the Electoral College requires a nuanced examination of its merits and drawbacks. While it ensures a certainty of outcome, encourages trans-regional appeal, and emphasizes the importance of swing states, critics rightly point out potential crises and unfairness in the system. A thorough evaluation of these factors is essential in determining the most effective and representative method for electing the President of the United States.

# What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register

1 The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

2 The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

3 The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . .

4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word “state” also refers to the District of Columbia.

5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate’s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .

6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state’s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate’s electors.

7 Most states have a “winner-take-all” system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of “proportional representation.” . . .

8 After the presidential election, your governor prepares a “Certificate of Ascertainment” listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state’s Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer

9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college

10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?

12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad.

Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

Dear [State Senator],

The ongoing debate surrounding the Electoral College and the prospect of transitioning to a popular vote for electing the President of the United States warrants careful consideration. As a concerned constituent, I wish to express my support for the retention of the Electoral College, citing its role in ensuring a certainty of outcome, trans-regional appeal, focus on swing states, consideration of large states, and avoidance of runoff elections.

One critical advantage of the Electoral College is its ability to provide a certainty of outcome, as outlined by Judge Richard A. Posner. This system minimizes the likelihood of disputes over election results, fostering stability and confidence in the electoral process. The winner-take-all approach in most states ensures a clear and undisputed victor, reducing the potential for chaotic post-election scenarios.

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes trans-regional appeal, preventing candidates from concentrating solely on regions where they are already popular. This characteristic, highlighted by Posner, encourages presidential candidates to engage with a diverse range of voters across the nation. By requiring candidates to secure electoral votes across various states, the system fosters a more inclusive campaign strategy, leading to a presidency that is representative of the entire country.

The emphasis on swing states is another strategic advantage of the Electoral College, encouraging candidates to focus their efforts on states where the outcome is uncertain. This approach, as argued by Posner, results in a more engaged and informed electorate. Voters in toss-up states play a decisive role in determining the election outcome, leading to a more thoughtful and comprehensive campaign that addresses a broader range of issues.

Consideration of large states is also a crucial aspect of the Electoral College, restoring balance to the political system. Posner points out that the winner-take-all method ensures that large states receive more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns. This attention is essential for maintaining a political balance, preventing candidates from neglecting the interests of voters in populous states.

Moreover, the Electoral College avoids the problem of runoff elections, as outlined by Posner. In instances where no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes cast, runoff elections may become necessary, complicating the electoral process. The Electoral College, by design, produces a clear winner, reducing the pressure for additional elections and ensuring a smoother transition of power.

While critics, such as Bradford Plumer, highlight concerns about potential crises and unfairness to voters, it is crucial to acknowledge that the Electoral College has demonstrated its resilience over time. The system has successfully weathered challenges, and its advantages in providing a stable, inclusive, and balanced electoral process remain compelling.

In conclusion, I urge you to consider the multiple benefits of the Electoral College in maintaining the integrity of the electoral process and ensuring a presidency that is representative of the diverse interests of our nation. While acknowledging the need for ongoing discussions and potential reforms, I believe that preserving the Electoral College is essential for upholding the democratic values and principles upon which our nation was founded.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

The Electoral College, a constitutional institution devised by the founding fathers, has been a subject of intense debate regarding its efficacy in electing the President of the United States. While critics, as exemplified by Bradford Plumer, argue vehemently for its abolition, proponents, as articulated by Judge Richard A. Posner, present compelling reasons to retain it. In this discourse, I advocate for the preservation of the Electoral College, emphasizing its role in ensuring a certainty of outcome, promoting trans-regional appeal, focusing on swing states, considering large states, and avoiding runoff elections.

One of the key merits of the Electoral College, highlighted by Posner, is its ability to provide a certainty of outcome. The winner-take-all system in most states contributes to a clear and undisputed election result. This minimizes the potential for post-election disputes, fostering stability and confidence in the democratic process. In contrast, a direct popular vote could lead to more frequent disputes and contested outcomes, as seen in the 2000 election crisis.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages presidential candidates to develop trans-regional appeal, preventing them from concentrating solely on regions where they are already popular. This is crucial in fostering a presidency that represents the interests of the entire nation. Without this system, candidates might focus disproportionately on densely populated areas, neglecting the concerns of citizens in less populous regions.

The focus on swing states is another strategic advantage of the Electoral College. Plumer criticizes this emphasis, arguing that it marginalizes voters in non-competitive states. However, Posner contends that the system encourages thoughtful campaigning and engagement in these pivotal states, ensuring that candidates address a diverse range of issues to secure electoral votes.

Consideration of large states is a critical aspect often overlooked by critics. Posner asserts that the winner-take-all method ensures that large states receive more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns. This attention is essential for maintaining a political balance, preventing candidates from neglecting the interests of voters in populous states.

Furthermore, the Electoral College, as Posner argues, avoids the problem of runoff elections, which could greatly complicate the electoral process. The current system ensures a clear winner without the need for additional rounds of voting, contributing to the efficiency and stability of the election process.

While critics, including Plumer, highlight potential crises and unfairness to voters, it is essential to acknowledge that the Electoral College has demonstrated its resilience over time. The system has successfully weathered challenges, and its advantages in providing a stable, inclusive, and balanced electoral process remain compelling.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, despite its imperfections, plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the electoral process. It ensures a certainty of outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal, focuses on swing states, considers large states, and avoids runoff elections. As we contemplate potential reforms, it is imperative to recognize the multifaceted benefits of the Electoral College in upholding democratic values and principles. Abolishing it, as suggested by critics, may inadvertently compromise the stability and fairness that the current system affords.

# What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register

1 The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

2 The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

3 The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . .

4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word “state” also refers to the District of Columbia.

5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate’s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .

6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state’s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate’s electors.

7 Most states have a “winner-take-all” system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of “proportional representation.” . . .

8 After the presidential election, your governor prepares a “Certificate of Ascertainment” listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state’s Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer

9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college

10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?

12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .

14 It’s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It’s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

# In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner

15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you’re actually voting for a slate of electors.

16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party’s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed) . . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons.

1) Certainty of Outcome

18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible—--it happened in 2000--—but it’s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012’s election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes—--538—--is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . .

2) Everyone’s President

19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised—to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn’t their president.

 3) Swing States

20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.
4) Big States

21 The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .

5) Avoid Run-Off Elections

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

Dear Senator,

The Electoral College has long been a cornerstone of the American electoral system, serving as a compromise between the election of the President by popular vote and by a vote in Congress. In this letter, I would like to advocate for the retention of the Electoral College, highlighting its role in ensuring a certainty of outcome, promoting trans-regional appeal, focusing on swing states, considering large states, and avoiding runoff elections.

One of the primary strengths of the Electoral College, as noted by Judge Richard A. Posner, is its ability to provide a certainty of outcome. The winner-take-all system in most states contributes to a clear and undisputed election result.

This is crucial in fostering a presidency that represents the interests of the entire nation. A candidate with only regional appeal is less likely to be a successful president, as residents in other regions may feel disenfranchised. The Electoral College, by requiring trans-regional appeal, promotes a more inclusive presidency.

The focus on swing states is another strategic advantage of the Electoral College. Critics argue that this marginalizes voters in non-competitive states; however, Posner contends that the system encourages thoughtful campaigning and engagement in these pivotal states.

Posner asserts that the winner-take-all method ensures that large states receive more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns. This attention is essential for maintaining a political balance, preventing candidates from neglecting the interests of voters in populous states. It ensures that candidates must address the concerns of citizens in both large and small states, promoting a more equitable representation.

Furthermore, the Electoral College, as Posner argues, avoids the problem of runoff elections, which could greatly complicate the electoral process. The current system ensures a clear winner without the need for additional rounds of voting, contributing to the efficiency and stability of the election process.

The debate over the Electoral College's role in electing the President of the United States has been a longstanding and contentious issue.

# What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register

1 The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

2 The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

3 The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . .

4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word “state” also refers to the District of Columbia.

5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate’s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .

6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state’s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate’s electors.

7 Most states have a “winner-take-all” system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of “proportional representation.” . . .

8 After the presidential election, your governor prepares a “Certificate of Ascertainment” listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state’s Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer

9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college

10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?

12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .

14 It’s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It’s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

# In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner

15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you’re actually voting for a slate of electors.

16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party’s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed) . . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons.

1) Certainty of Outcome

18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible—--it happened in 2000--—but it’s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012’s election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes—--538—--is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . .

2) Everyone’s President

19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised—to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn’t their president.

 3) Swing States

20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.
4) Big States

21 The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .

5) Avoid Run-Off Elections

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

Dear [State Senator],

I am writing to express my views on the ongoing debate surrounding the Electoral College and the method of electing the President of the United States. This issue has garnered significant attention, with advocates and critics presenting compelling arguments. After considering information from multiple sources, including "What Is the Electoral College?" by the Office of the Federal Register and the contrasting perspectives presented in "The Indefensible Electoral College" by Bradford Plumer and "In Defense of the Electoral College" by Judge Richard A. Posner, I am inclined to argue in favor of retaining the Electoral College.

One of the central claims in support of the Electoral College is its ability to provide certainty of outcome. As Judge Posner points out, the winner-take-all system in most states contributes to a clear and undisputed election result. This minimizes the potential for post-election disputes, fostering stability and confidence in the democratic process. The Electoral College has proven its effectiveness in ensuring a decisive and accepted outcome, as demonstrated in numerous past elections.

Critics, such as Plumer, highlight potential issues with the electoral system, including the so-called "disaster factor." However, it is essential to recognize that the Electoral College has weathered challenges throughout history. While the disaster scenarios presented by critics are cause for concern, they remain exceptional rather than routine occurrences. The system's ability to adapt and endure through various circumstances suggests its resilience in maintaining the integrity of the electoral process.

Another compelling argument in favor of the Electoral College is its promotion of trans-regional appeal. As Judge Posner notes, this system prevents candidates from concentrating solely on regions where they are already popular, fostering a presidency that represents the interests of the entire nation. By requiring candidates to appeal to a broad spectrum of voters, the Electoral College contributes to a more inclusive and representative democracy.

Furthermore, the focus on swing states, as outlined by Judge Posner, encourages thoughtful campaigning and engagement. While critics argue that this marginalizes voters in non-competitive states, the system ensures that candidates address a diverse range of issues to secure electoral votes. This results in a more informed electorate, as candidates strive to meet the concerns of voters in pivotal states.

In conclusion, while acknowledging the criticisms and concerns raised by opponents of the Electoral College, the system has demonstrated its efficacy in providing a stable, inclusive, and balanced electoral process. Retaining the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal, focuses on swing states, and addresses the interests of both large and small states. As we contemplate potential reforms, it is crucial to recognize the multifaceted benefits of the Electoral College in upholding democratic values and principles.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

The debate over the Electoral College's role in electing the President of the United States has persisted since the country's founding. While critics, as exemplified by Bradford Plumer, argue for its abolition, there are compelling reasons, outlined by Judge Richard A. Posner, to retain this system.

One primary argument in favor of the Electoral College is its ability to ensure a certainty of outcome. As Posner notes, the winner-take-all system employed by most states results in a clear electoral-vote victory, minimizing the likelihood of disputes over the election's outcome. This stability is crucial for maintaining public trust in the democratic process. Plumer's concerns about the disaster factor, although valid, highlight exceptional rather than routine occurrences, and the Electoral College has demonstrated resilience in the face of challenges.

Another critical advantage of the Electoral College is its promotion of trans-regional appeal. Posner argues that this system prevents candidates from concentrating solely on regions where they are already popular, fostering a presidency that represents the interests of the entire nation. This prevents the disenfranchisement of voters in certain regions and contributes to a more inclusive democracy.

Additionally, the focus on swing states, as Posner highlights, encourages thoughtful campaigning and voter engagement. Critics argue that this marginalizes voters in non-competitive states, but the Electoral College ensures that candidates address a diverse range of issues to secure electoral votes. This results in a more informed electorate, as candidates strive to meet the concerns of voters in pivotal states.

Posner also argues that the Electoral College restores balance to the political influence of large and small states. In a direct popular vote system, large states could overshadow smaller ones, leading to a concentration of political attention. The Electoral College, through its allocation of electoral votes, ensures that both large and small states receive due consideration during presidential campaigns.

While acknowledging Plumer's concerns about potential issues, including ties and the winner-take-all system, Posner contends that the benefits of the Electoral College, such as avoiding run-off elections and ensuring a clear winner, outweigh these drawbacks.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, despite criticisms, remains a crucial component of the U.S. electoral system. Its ability to provide certainty of outcome, promote trans-regional appeal, focus on swing states, and restore balance among states demonstrates its continued relevance in preserving a stable, inclusive, and representative democracy.

12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .

14 It’s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It’s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

# In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner

15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you’re actually voting for a slate of electors.

16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party’s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed) . . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons.

1) Certainty of Outcome

18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible—--it happened in 2000--—but it’s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012’s election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes—--538—--is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . .

2) Everyone’s President

19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised—to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn’t their president.

 3) Swing States

20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.
4) Big States

21 The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .

5) Avoid Run-Off Elections

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

The debate over the Electoral College's role in electing the President of the United States is complex, with valid arguments on both sides. While some, like Bradford Plumer, advocate for its abolition, Judge Richard A. Posner provides compelling reasons to retain this system. In considering this matter, it is crucial to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of the Electoral College to make an informed decision.

One critical advantage of the Electoral College, as highlighted by Posner, is the certainty of outcome. The winner-take-all system in most states ensures a clear electoral-vote victory, reducing the likelihood of disputes over the election's outcome. This stability is essential for maintaining public trust in the democratic process, as a disputed election could erode citizens' confidence in the electoral system.

Moreover, the Electoral College encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal, preventing them from concentrating solely on regions where they are already popular. This fosters a presidency that represents the interests of the entire nation, preventing the disenfranchisement of voters in specific regions. Critics argue that this marginalizes voters in non-competitive states, but the Electoral College ensures that candidates address a diverse range of issues to secure electoral votes.

Additionally, the focus on swing states, as noted by Posner, promotes thoughtful campaigning and voter engagement. While critics claim this marginalizes voters in non-swing states, the Electoral College ensures candidates address a broad range of issues to secure electoral votes. This results in a more informed electorate, as candidates strive to meet the concerns of voters in pivotal states.

Posner's argument that the Electoral College restores balance among states of different sizes is also noteworthy. In a direct popular vote system, large states might overshadow smaller ones, leading to a concentration of political attention. The Electoral College, through its allocation of electoral votes, ensures that both large and small states receive due consideration during presidential campaigns.

While Plumer raises concerns about potential issues, including ties and the winner-take-all system, Posner contends that the benefits of the Electoral College outweigh these drawbacks. The system's ability to provide a clear outcome, foster trans-regional appeal, encourage thoughtful campaigning, and balance political influence among states underscores its continued relevance.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, despite its imperfections, remains a crucial component of the U.S. electoral system. Its ability to ensure a certainty of outcome, promote trans-regional appeal, focus on swing states, and restore balance among states demonstrates its continued relevance in preserving a stable, inclusive, and representative democracy. As discussions about the electoral process persist, it is essential to consider these factors carefully before making any decisions about potential reforms.

# What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register

1 The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

2 The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

3 The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . .

4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word “state” also refers to the District of Columbia.

5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate’s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .

6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state’s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate’s electors.

7 Most states have a “winner-take-all” system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of “proportional representation.” . . .

8 After the presidential election, your governor prepares a “Certificate of Ascertainment” listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state’s Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer

9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college

10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?

12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.

Subject: In Defense of the Electoral College: Preserving a Time-Tested System

The Electoral College has been a fundamental aspect of the United States' presidential election process since its inception, serving as a compromise between direct popular vote and congressional selection. While some argue for its abolition, citing concerns of fairness and potential crises, it is essential to recognize the system's merits and the practical reasons supporting its continuation.

One crucial advantage of the Electoral College is the certainty it provides in determining the election outcome. As outlined by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winner-takes-all approach in most states ensures that the victor's share of electoral votes exceeds their share of the popular vote. This not only minimizes the likelihood of disputes but also promotes a decisive and stable electoral result, preventing the need for run-off elections and potential political turmoil.

Furthermore, the Electoral College fosters a president with trans-regional appeal, as highlighted by Posner. This ensures that no single region, such as the South or Northeast, holds enough electoral votes to secure victory. Candidates must appeal to diverse geographical areas, discouraging regionalism and promoting a president who considers the interests of the entire nation. This broad-based support is vital for effective governance and national cohesion.

The emphasis on swing states, another feature of the Electoral College, encourages thoughtful voter engagement. Posner argues that voters in these states are more likely to pay close attention to campaigns, fostering an informed electorate that plays a crucial role in deciding the election. This targeted approach ensures that candidates address the concerns of a diverse range of voters and prevents a scenario where only a few swing voters in specific states hold the fate of the presidency.

Additionally, the Electoral College provides a counterbalance to the mal-apportionment of the Senate, restoring political balance by giving larger states their due attention during campaigns. This prevents the domination of electoral strategies by smaller states and encourages candidates to address the needs of more populous states, ensuring a more equitable distribution of attention and resources.

While some critics argue that the Electoral College is unfair and outdated, it is crucial to recognize that its existence has been supported by practical reasons rather than political ideology. The disaster factor, as highlighted by opponents, is mitigated by historical infrequency and the overall stability the system provides. Furthermore, the Electoral College has proven effective in preserving the integrity of the electoral process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, with its historical significance and practical advantages, remains a vital component of the American electoral system. While calls for its abolition persist, a careful consideration of its merits in providing a stable, nationally representative outcome should guide our approach. The system encourages broad-based appeal, thoughtful voter engagement, and political balance, all essential elements for a robust democracy.

Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.
4) Big States

21 The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .

5) Avoid Run-Off Elections

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

The Electoral College, a process integral to the American democratic system since its inception, has been a subject of ongoing debate. While some argue for its abolition in favor of a direct popular vote, it is crucial to consider the system's historical significance and the practical reasons for its retention.

The Founding Fathers established the Electoral College as a compromise between congressional selection and a direct popular vote, as outlined by the Office of the Federal Register. This compromise aimed to ensure that both the interests of the states and the voice of the people were represented in the election of the President. The process involves the selection of electors, their meeting to vote for the President and Vice President, and the subsequent counting of electoral votes by Congress.

Critics of the Electoral College, such as Bradford Plumer, argue that the system is flawed, citing instances of potential crises and fairness issues. However, Judge Richard A. Posner provides practical reasons for retaining the Electoral College, emphasizing the certainty of outcomes, the importance of trans-regional appeal, the focus on swing states, the consideration of large states, and the avoidance of run-off elections.

One of the primary advantages Posner highlights is the certainty of outcome. The Electoral College minimizes the likelihood of disputes, as the winning candidate's share of electoral votes typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. This characteristic ensures a stable electoral result and reduces the need for run-off elections, streamlining the presidential election process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal, preventing them from focusing solely on certain regions. This ensures that candidates must consider the interests of a diverse nation, fostering a president with broad-based support and reducing regionalism.

The emphasis on swing states is another critical aspect of the Electoral College defended by Posner. This focus encourages thoughtful voter engagement in states where the election outcome is less predictable, ensuring that voters in these states play a crucial role in deciding the presidency. This targeted approach promotes a more informed and engaged electorate.

The system also restores balance to the political weight of large states, addressing the mal-apportionment of the Senate. Posner argues that the Electoral College ensures that candidates pay attention to populous states, preventing the domination of electoral strategies by smaller states and promoting a more equitable distribution of attention and resources.

While critics argue that the Electoral College is unfair to voters due to the winner-take-all system, it is essential to recognize that the system has practical benefits. The winner-take-all approach contributes to the stability of the electoral process and prevents candidates from focusing solely on states they are sure to win.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, despite facing criticism, remains a vital component of the American electoral system. The practical reasons for its retention, such as ensuring certainty of outcomes, promoting trans-regional appeal, focusing on swing states, considering large states, and avoiding run-off elections, contribute to the system's effectiveness. As the nation continues to grapple with the debate over the Electoral College, it is crucial to weigh its historical significance and practical advantages in maintaining a stable and representative presidential election process.

# What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register

1 The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

2 The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

3 The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . .

4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word “state” also refers to the District of Columbia.

5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate’s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .

6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state’s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate’s electors.

7 Most states have a “winner-take-all” system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of “proportional representation.” . . .

8 After the presidential election, your governor prepares a “Certificate of Ascertainment” listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state’s Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer

9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college

10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?

12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .

14 It’s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It’s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

# In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner

15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you’re actually voting for a slate of electors.

16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party’s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed) . . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons.

1) Certainty of Outcome

18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible—--it happened in 2000--—but it’s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012’s election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes—--538—--is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . .

2) Everyone’s President

19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised—to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn’t their president.

 3) Swing States

20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.

But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

Dear Senator,

The debate surrounding the Electoral College has been ongoing, with advocates and critics presenting compelling arguments. As a concerned citizen, I believe that the Electoral College, despite its imperfections, serves a crucial role in preserving the integrity of the presidential election process.

The Office of the Federal Register highlights that the Electoral College was established as a compromise between the election of the President by Congress and a popular vote by citizens. This compromise reflects the Founding Fathers' intent to balance the interests of states and citizens in the election process. The Electoral College process involves the selection of electors, their voting for the President and Vice President, and the subsequent counting of electoral votes by Congress.

Critics, as outlined in Bradford Plumer's article, argue that the Electoral College has inherent flaws, such as the potential for "disaster factors" like faithless electors and the possibility of a tie in the electoral vote. While these concerns are valid, Judge Richard A. Posner offers practical reasons for retaining the Electoral College, focusing on the certainty of outcomes, trans-regional appeal, the importance of swing states, consideration of large states, and the avoidance of run-off elections.

One of the key strengths of the Electoral College, as highlighted by Posner, is the certainty of outcome. The winner-take-all system ensures that the winning candidate's share of electoral votes typically exceeds their share of the popular vote, minimizing the likelihood of disputes. This characteristic contributes to a stable electoral result and reduces the need for run-off elections, preventing potential complications in the presidential election process.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal, preventing them from concentrating solely on specific regions. This approach fosters a president with broad-based support, reducing regionalism and ensuring that the interests of diverse regions are considered.

The focus on swing states is another crucial aspect defended by Posner. This emphasis encourages thoughtful voter engagement in states where the election outcome is less predictable, ensuring that voters in these states play a pivotal role in deciding the presidency. This targeted approach promotes a more informed and engaged electorate.

Moreover, the Electoral College restores balance to the political weight of large states, addressing the mal-apportionment of the Senate. This ensures that candidates pay attention to populous states, preventing the domination of electoral strategies by smaller states and promoting a more equitable distribution of attention and resources.

While the winner-take-all system may seem unfair to voters in states with no chance of winning, it is essential to recognize that the Electoral College system has practical benefits. The stability it provides and the prevention of run-off elections contribute to an efficient and streamlined presidential election process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, though not without flaws, plays a vital role in maintaining the integrity and stability of the presidential election process. By addressing the concerns raised by critics and acknowledging its practical advantages, we can work towards a system that ensures fair representation for all citizens and upholds the principles laid out by the Founding Fathers.

The debate over the Electoral College versus a popular vote system for electing the President of the United States has been a longstanding issue. Advocates of the Electoral College, such as Judge Richard A. Posner, present compelling practical reasons to retain this system, emphasizing the certainty of outcome, the need for a president with trans-regional appeal, the significance of swing states, the consideration of large states, and the avoidance of run-off elections.

One of the key arguments in favor of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. Posner contends that the winner-take-all system, wherein almost all states award electoral votes on this basis, reduces the likelihood of disputes over the election results. The Electoral College ensures that even a slight plurality in a state translates into a significant electoral-vote victory, contributing to the stability of the electoral process.

Another crucial aspect highlighted by Posner is the Electoral College's requirement for presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. This characteristic prevents candidates from concentrating solely on specific regions, encouraging a president with broad-based support. By ensuring that candidates appeal to a diverse range of voters, the Electoral College aims to reduce regionalism and promote a president who represents the entire nation.

The focus on swing states is also defended by Posner, who argues that the winner-take-all method induces candidates to concentrate their campaign efforts on states where the election outcome is less predictable. This emphasis promotes voter engagement in these states, encouraging a more informed and thoughtful electorate. Posner asserts that thoughtful voters in swing states should play a decisive role in determining the election outcome.

Additionally, Posner addresses the political balance, stating that the Electoral College restores some weight to the influence of large states in the political process. This is crucial to prevent the domination of electoral strategies by smaller states, ensuring that candidates pay attention to populous states and promoting a more equitable distribution of attention and resources.

Furthermore, the Electoral College is argued to avoid the complications of run-off elections, as highlighted by Posner. By invariably producing a clear winner, the Electoral College minimizes the pressure for run-off elections that could greatly complicate the presidential election process.

While critics, as outlined in Bradford Plumer's article, raise concerns about the fairness and potential flaws in the Electoral College system, Posner provides practical reasons for its retention. The system's ability to deliver a stable outcome, encourage broad-based appeal, engage thoughtful voters in swing states, consider the influence of large states, and avoid run-off elections underscores the advantages of the Electoral College in the presidential election process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, despite its imperfections, plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability and fairness of the presidential election process. By addressing the concerns raised by critics and acknowledging its practical advantages, we can work towards a system that ensures fair representation for all citizens and upholds the principles laid out by the Founding Fathers.

# What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register

1 The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

2 The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

3 The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state’s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . .

4 Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word “state” also refers to the District of Columbia.

5 Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate’s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. . . .

6 The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state’s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate’s electors.

7 Most states have a “winner-take-all” system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of “proportional representation.” . . .

8 After the presidential election, your governor prepares a “Certificate of Ascertainment” listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state’s Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

# The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer

9 What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They’re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore—thanks to the quirks of the electoral college—won the popular vote but lost the presidency,1 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives? . . . What’s wrong with the electoral college

10 Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you’d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party’s central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

11 The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, “faithless” electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party’s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. . . . Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent’s electors, but he made sure to do so “without establishing a precedent.” What if it happened again?

12 Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House’s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

13 At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the “swing” states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn’t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn’t get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. . . .

14 It’s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It’s hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

# In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Judge Richard A. Posner

15 The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism,1 a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you’re actually voting for a slate of electors.

16 But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party’s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed) . . . however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

17 There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree;2 all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative3 reasons.

1) Certainty of Outcome

18 A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible—--it happened in 2000--—but it’s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012’s election, for example, Obama4 received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.5 . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality6 in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes—--538—--is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . .

2) Everyone’s President

19 The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised—to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn’t their president.

 3) Swing States

20 The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates—as we saw in 2012’s election—to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states . . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign—to really listen to the competing candidates—knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.
4) Big States

21 The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. . . . The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . .

5) Avoid Run-Off Elections

22 The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. . . .

23 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state—Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote . . . . But of course no voter’s vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012’s election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . .

Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my strong support for retaining the Electoral College system in the election of the President of the United States. While there are compelling arguments for both the Electoral College and a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College, as outlined by the Office of the Federal Register and Judge Richard A. Posner, offers practical benefits that contribute to the stability, fairness, and effectiveness of the presidential election process.

One of the key advantages of the Electoral College, highlighted by Judge Posner, is the certainty of outcome. The winner-take-all system, where almost all states award electoral votes on this basis, reduces the likelihood of disputes over election results. This stability is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the electoral process and ensuring a smooth transition of power.

Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal, as each party must select a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee. This requirement helps prevent candidates from concentrating solely on specific regions, promoting a president with broad-based support. In contrast, a popular vote system might allow candidates to focus only on densely populated areas, potentially neglecting the concerns and interests of voters in less populous regions.

The focus on swing states, another advantage of the Electoral College, ensures that candidates pay attention to states where the election outcome is less predictable. This emphasis promotes voter engagement in those states, encouraging a more informed and thoughtful electorate. By concentrating campaign efforts in toss-up states, candidates are compelled to address a diverse range of issues that resonate with voters across the nation.

Judge Posner also argues that the Electoral College restores balance to the political influence of large states. In a campaign, candidates are incentivized to pay attention to both large and small states, preventing the domination of electoral strategies by densely populated regions. This ensures that the concerns of voters in all states are considered, promoting a more equitable distribution of attention and resources.

While critics, as outlined in Bradford Plumer's article, point out potential flaws in the Electoral College system, such as the winner-take-all approach and the possibility of a tie, these concerns can be addressed through reforms rather than outright abolition. Retaining the Electoral College allows for practical adjustments that can enhance its fairness and effectiveness.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, despite its imperfections, plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability and fairness of the presidential election process. By addressing the concerns raised by critics and acknowledging its practical advantages, we can work towards a system that ensures fair representation for all citizens and upholds the principles laid out by the Founding Fathers.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
