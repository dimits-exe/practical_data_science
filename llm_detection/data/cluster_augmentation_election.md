## You
Write a letter to your state senator in which you argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Use the information from the texts in your essay. Manage your time carefully so that you can read the passages; plan your response; write your response; and revise and edit your response. Be sure to include a claim; address counterclaims; use evidence from multiple sources; and avoid overly relying on one source. Your response should be in the form of a multiparagraph essay. Write your response in the space provided. 

You are a US high school student. Use language fitting an average US teenager, imitating the structure and tone of the examples below. 

Example 1:
"There has been a fuss about the Elector College. Many people get confused about how it works and if they're satisfied with the whole process. Show we "abolish" the Elector College? Should we keep it? Honestly we should keep it. We the peope have more then enough control on who is chosen for the president of the United States Of America. We don't really vote for the president but our vote impacts the decision.

Many citizens of the United States Of America think their vote doesn matter, it does. Why? Well, first the government is runned by the people. Its very rare to not get the president that has the most popular votes, the last time when the president wasn't chosen was in 1888. It's less likely for the president with the most votes to lose the election. For example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the elector votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney. Plus, almost all states award elector votes on a winnertakeitall basis.

Perhaps, there was no system. Would it be simpler? Yes it would but we have to also be fair, there is 538 electors and a majority of 270 elector votes is required to elect the president. When you are voting for the president ypu want to win,you are actually voting for your canidate's elector. How does the system work? First it's the process that has the selection of the electors , the meeting of the electors where they vote for the president and vice president , and last but not least the counting of electoral votes by congress. Obviously it is kind of confusing because it would be much simpler if the winner would be the one with the most popular votes.

Did you know that the Elector College avoids the problem of elections? They do due to how much pressure the candidte can go through. It can easily complicate the presidential process. For instance, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Elector College 301 and 370 elector votes exactly. When avoiding the elections and campaigns , there a better chance of clear winner.

So there you have it,three main reason's why we should keep the Elector College. We have why the process is important and why we have it. How the process work's because it was confusing to many people , so it's defined and hopefully you'll like to stay and support the Elector College. Your vote does matter."

Example2:
"During my life i have watched many presidential elections on my television. To me the Electoral College on paper should work, Should being the key word. As I read the paragraphs on both why the Electoral College work and does not work I have decides the side with not having the Electoral College.

Historical evidence and evidence from this paragraph piont to not having a Electoral College. One reason for this was when Al Gore lost the presidency but won the popular vote nation wide as stated in Source 2. another piont is that if the people have so munch power over who is voted to be president then how do we have a president that the people did not want the president but the person is still elected, its an outrage! One example of how the Electoral College could be a disaster waiting to happen is that the votes are tied which may seem not likey at first glance but say if the votes are tied the presidency is thrown into the House of Representatives which lets face it, in the end the decision will not be approved by the people and the people will then barely have a say on who gets to be president or not. Another thing is the Electoral College can also be vary bisest towrdes one party or the other. This is evident because if a certain party got more electors than another party which whould led to a canedat from one party have more support then another.

Source 3 talks about how sure thats its possible for their to be a tie in the Electoral College but its unlikely supports what im trying the say in my earlier Paragraph, that even though a tie is unlikely it is still possible to happen the chance is still their. This paragraph also says the everyone is a president but if that is the case then why dose the poeple that "we" vote for the electoral College help vote for the president insted vote for the other canadate is an atrosidy on its own. The winnertakeall system is one that only afects the swing states because if thoughs states have already voted then the staes the already votes whould be for not because the numbers for who gets voted whould be already in favor of one state or another. The fact the larger states have a bigger say in who gets voted on is not fair. the is becuase if all the big states vote for someone and about 14 of the smaller states vote on one end of the scale and the other states vote towrdes the other end of the scale then the ballence whould be off and one side would overpower the other side by fact of shear numbers of votes compared to the other side.

After reading over my responce and the evidence that I have profided form the paragraph hear I have with great pride that i have argued my point across to you that the Electoral College in paper is good but in reality is only a crumbleing castle waiting to fall into the tiny bites and pieces that it should be."

Example 3:
"To who it may concern, With all the problems affiliated with the Electoral College, I believe that the United States should do away with the process. This process by which the president is elected is unfair to those of us who are old enough to vote and understand politics. Another disadvantage is that the system of Electoral College is very confusing to many people.

The worst thing about the Electoral College is that it is just outright puzzling. Men who are running for a spot as a presidential candidate are not voted for by the citizens of that state. They have to gain supporters who then become the electors. Then the people of that state have to vote for the electors, not the person to become a presidential candidate. Voters can't even directly vote for who they want. What if you vote for a slate of electors, who are supposed to be in favor of the presidential candidate you want, but don't vote for him? What happens then? presidential candidates who should actually get a chance at running for president because they didn't get enough electoral votes. This all leads to the next disadvantage of the Electoral College, unfairness.

As stated in an article by Bradford Plumer, "... Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency." The person running for president should be voted for directly by the voters. Someone, such as Al Gore, can get enough of the popular votes, but not enough of the electoral votes becuase they can't swing the votes in some states. This basically means that the majority of the United States would like to have Al Gore as a president, but couldn't because the majority of people in a state didn't want him as president.

To sum it up, the Electoral College should be eliminated from the presidential voting process. People should just directly vote for who they want as president and see where it goes from there."

Example 4:
"Senator, I believe that voting for the president of the United States should be based off of the popular vote by the people. Not the Electoral College. Voting by the Electoral College does not allow the people to have the final say. It ultimately gives the elector the choice. "The 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century" Bradford Plumer, paragraph 14, it was a disaster factor. The electors went against the will of the people and voted the opposite of what they said. Whose to say something like this can't happen again soon?

Some people say that the Electoral College is a good thing. It allows a certainty of outcome and is a fair, reasonable way to vote for a president. But it is based off of trust, that the elector won't betray the candidate's party and people. Trust. Are you really going to put your vote for the president of your country in someone else hand based off of trust?

Having an elector represent your state based off of population is ridiculous. One elector representing 500,000 people in Wyoming. Wouldn't you sleep better at night if you could represent yourself instead of someone representing you and thousands of other people all at once.

In 2000, a candidate had more popular votes, and less electoral votes and lost! Even though the people had more votes! How do you feel knowing that your vote doesn't even count? "Most states have a winnertakeall' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate"the Office of the Federal Register,paragraph 7. Because of this system, candidates will not spend time in certain states they know they have no chance in winning in. "During the 2000 campaign seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all"Bradford Plumer, paragraph 13 Next time you go into that voting booth, remember that you're not voting for a president, you're voting and are supposed to trust an elector."

Example 5:
"The Electoral College has been established since the founding of our country. It is a system that has been tried and tested to work over the course of centuries. It should be upheld for it's ability to produce a solid outcome, and though it has the possibility of failing it's faults are not worse than the popular vote system, and that the Electoral College fosters a presidency campaign that appeals to multiple regions of the United States. This fair system allows representation of the people's will, just like the rest of our government does.

Faith in a certain outcome of the presidential election ensures that the vote has as little complications as possible, and is a reason the Electoral College is necessary. According to source one, "What Is The Electoral College?", each political party has it's own set of electors that equal the amount of congressional delegates per state. Usually each state has a "winnertakeall" method, so the presidential candidate that gets majority in your state will get all of the electors that represent their party, not just most of them. This is beneficial to the outcome of the election because it makes the ability for a candidate to get majority vote much simpler. There is less of a possibility of a tie, or an outcome where no candidate wins. Source 3, "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep out despised method of choosing president", states that "even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state..." , therefore allowing the candidate to secure all votes to their side, instead of having the votes divided on the line of majority rule, and causing rifts between Electoral College voters.

No system is perfect, and the Electoral College is not exempt from this. "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong", Source 2, argues that a term called disaster factor', or the possibility of imminent disaster due to the Electoral College system, is why the Electoral College system should be abolished. The passage uses individual instances, like the fact that in 1960, segrigationists in louisiana nearly appointed Democratic electors that would vote against their candidate, or that in rare instances, "faithless" electoral voters would vote for the other side. These are starman arguments, using specific instances to come to a conclusion that the whole system should be abolished. While the Electoral College system isn't perfect, neither is the popular vote system. The popular vote system has a higher chance of causing a tie between candidates, and it doesn't have a "winnertakeall" standard. In a tie, the vote would be given to the House of Representatives, which, according to source 2, "..can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people..", as citizens often vote one party in for president and another for Congress.

In addition, the Electoral College fosters a more nationwide appeal for the candidate's campaign. Source 3 brings up the fact that no region in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The "winnertakeall" system further benefits this, because in order to win, candidates have to focus their attention on states where their majority vote is insecure. They will not focus on regions where they have essentially secured the majority rule and therefore secured all the electoral votes. In popular vote, they would have to focus extensively on those regions, as the few that are not in the majority would need convincing. Source 3 goes into detail as to why a regionally picked candidate is not a proper show of the will of the people. It states that "The residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised to feel that thier votes do not count, that their new preident will have no regard for their interests...", and so having a transregional appeal is essential to properly representing the will of United States citizens.

Our Electoral College system should be defended and kept. It has the ability to produce a solid outcome, has flaws but ones that are not more disasterous than other systems, and drives candidates to try and present a national appeal. A single vote does not decide an election, the representation of our people should not be split in half, divided. The Electoral College does its best to give the nation the president it deserves."

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this message reaches you well. As a high school student concerned about the current discussions surrounding the Electoral College, I feel compelled to express my support for maintaining this system in the presidential elections.

The Electoral College, though often criticized, serves a crucial role in our democratic process. Contrary to the sentiments of those advocating for its abolition, the Electoral College ensures that the president is chosen with consideration for the entire nation rather than being decided solely by densely populated areas. This point is well illustrated by the fact that candidates must have transregional appeal to secure victory, preventing them from concentrating only on populous regions, as mentioned in Example 1.

One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College is its ability to provide a clear and decisive outcome, as highlighted in the first example. The winner-takes-all approach minimizes the risk of tied votes and prevents the need for runoff elections, which could be both time-consuming and financially burdensome for the country. This certainty of outcome contributes to the stability and efficiency of the presidential election process.

Moreover, the Electoral College encourages a more thoughtful and strategic approach to campaigning, as discussed in Example 1. Candidates are required to appeal to a diverse range of states, considering both the large and small, urban and rural, thereby preventing the dominance of a few highly populated regions over the entire nation. This fosters a fair representation of the interests and concerns of citizens from various parts of the country.

While some argue for the popular vote system, it is crucial to address the potential flaws and drawbacks associated with it. For instance, the possibility of tied votes, the lack of a winner-takes-all standard, and the concentration of candidate focus on densely populated areas are challenges that could undermine the fairness and representativeness of the election process.

In conclusion, I urge you to consider the advantages of the Electoral College in ensuring a fair and balanced representation of the nation's interests in presidential elections. While it may have imperfections, it stands as a vital element of our democratic process that requires careful consideration before any decisions are made. Thank you for your time and dedication to serving our community.

Sincerely,

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. As a high school student closely following the discussions on the future of the Electoral College, I am writing to express my support for retaining this system in the presidential elections or, at the very least, maintaining a thoughtful and careful approach to any potential changes.

In the ongoing debate about the Electoral College, it is crucial to recognize the advantages it offers in terms of ensuring a fair and balanced representation of the entire nation. While some argue for the popular vote system, the Electoral College prevents candidates from concentrating solely on densely populated areas and necessitates transregional appeal for victory. This is highlighted in Example 1, where it is mentioned that the system encourages a more nationwide focus, preventing the dominance of a few highly populated regions over the entire nation.

One of the key strengths of the Electoral College is its ability to provide a clear and decisive outcome. The winner-takes-all approach minimizes the risk of tied votes and ensures that a candidate securing a majority in a state gets all the electors representing that state. This simplicity in outcome, as mentioned in Example 5, contributes to the stability and efficiency of the presidential election process, preventing the need for lengthy runoff elections that could be both time-consuming and costly for the country.

Furthermore, the Electoral College addresses concerns about potential biases in favor of one party or another. Example 2 points out that the system prevents the presidency from being decided solely by the majority in larger states, thereby maintaining a balance that prevents the overpowering of one side by sheer numbers. This ensures that candidates need to appeal to a diverse range of states, large and small, urban and rural, for a chance at victory.

While no system is perfect, the potential flaws associated with the Electoral College, such as the "disaster factor" mentioned in Example 5, should be weighed against the flaws of alternative systems. The popular vote system, as discussed in the same example, has a higher chance of causing ties between candidates and lacks the winner-takes-all standard, potentially leading to more complications and uncertainties in the election process.

In conclusion, I urge you to consider the advantages of the Electoral College in maintaining a fair and balanced representation of the nation's interests in presidential elections. Any potential changes to the system should be approached with caution, ensuring that the proposed alternatives do not introduce new challenges or biases. I appreciate your time and dedication to serving our community, and I trust that you will carefully consider the perspectives of young constituents like me.

One reason for this was when Al Gore lost the presidency but won the popular vote nation wide as stated in Source 2. another piont is that if the people have so munch power over who is voted to be president then how do we have a president that the people did not want the president but the person is still elected, its an outrage! One example of how the Electoral College could be a disaster waiting to happen is that the votes are tied which may seem not likey at first glance but say if the votes are tied the presidency is thrown into the House of Representatives which lets face it, in the end the decision will not be approved by the people and the people will then barely have a say on who gets to be president or not. Another thing is the Electoral College can also be vary bisest towrdes one party or the other. This is evident because if a certain party got more electors than another party which whould led to a canedat from one party have more support then another.

Source 3 talks about how sure thats its possible for their to be a tie in the Electoral College but its unlikely supports what im trying the say in my earlier Paragraph, that even though a tie is unlikely it is still possible to happen the chance is still their. This paragraph also says the everyone is a president but if that is the case then why dose the poeple that "we" vote for the electoral College help vote for the president insted vote for the other canadate is an atrosidy on its own. The winnertakeall system is one that only afects the swing states because if thoughs states have already voted then the staes the already votes whould be for not because the numbers for who gets voted whould be already in favor of one state or another. The fact the larger states have a bigger say in who gets voted on is not fair. the is becuase if all the big states vote for someone and about 14 of the smaller states vote on one end of the scale and the other states vote towrdes the other end of the scale then the ballence whould be off and one side would overpower the other side by fact of shear numbers of votes compared to the other side.

After reading over my responce and the evidence that I have profided form the paragraph hear I have with great pride that i have argued my point across to you that the Electoral College in paper is good but in reality is only a crumbleing castle waiting to fall into the tiny bites and pieces that it should be."

Example 3:
"To who it may concern, With all the problems affiliated with the Electoral College, I believe that the United States should do away with the process. This process by which the president is elected is unfair to those of us who are old enough to vote and understand politics. Another disadvantage is that the system of Electoral College is very confusing to many people.

The worst thing about the Electoral College is that it is just outright puzzling. Men who are running for a spot as a presidential candidate are not voted for by the citizens of that state. They have to gain supporters who then become the electors. Then the people of that state have to vote for the electors, not the person to become a presidential candidate. Voters can't even directly vote for who they want. What if you vote for a slate of electors, who are supposed to be in favor of the presidential candidate you want, but don't vote for him? What happens then? presidential candidates who should actually get a chance at running for president because they didn't get enough electoral votes. This all leads to the next disadvantage of the Electoral College, unfairness.

As stated in an article by Bradford Plumer, "... Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency." The person running for president should be voted for directly by the voters. Someone, such as Al Gore, can get enough of the popular votes, but not enough of the electoral votes becuase they can't swing the votes in some states. This basically means that the majority of the United States would like to have Al Gore as a president, but couldn't because the majority of people in a state didn't want him as president.

To sum it up, the Electoral College should be eliminated from the presidential voting process. People should just directly vote for who they want as president and see where it goes from there."

Example 4:
"Senator, I believe that voting for the president of the United States should be based off of the popular vote by the people. Not the Electoral College. Voting by the Electoral College does not allow the people to have the final say. It ultimately gives the elector the choice. "The 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century" Bradford Plumer, paragraph 14, it was a disaster factor. The electors went against the will of the people and voted the opposite of what they said. Whose to say something like this can't happen again soon?

Some people say that the Electoral College is a good thing. It allows a certainty of outcome and is a fair, reasonable way to vote for a president. But it is based off of trust, that the elector won't betray the candidate's party and people. Trust. Are you really going to put your vote for the president of your country in someone else hand based off of trust?

Having an elector represent your state based off of population is ridiculous. One elector representing 500,000 people in Wyoming. Wouldn't you sleep better at night if you could represent yourself instead of someone representing you and thousands of other people all at once.

In 2000, a candidate had more popular votes, and less electoral votes and lost! Even though the people had more votes! How do you feel knowing that your vote doesn't even count? "Most states have a winnertakeall' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate"the Office of the Federal Register,paragraph 7. Because of this system, candidates will not spend time in certain states they know they have no chance in winning in. "During the 2000 campaign seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all"Bradford Plumer, paragraph 13 Next time you go into that voting booth, remember that you're not voting for a president, you're voting and are supposed to trust an elector."

Example 5:
"The Electoral College has been established since the founding of our country. It is a system that has been tried and tested to work over the course of centuries. It should be upheld for it's ability to produce a solid outcome, and though it has the possibility of failing it's faults are not worse than the popular vote system, and that the Electoral College fosters a presidency campaign that appeals to multiple regions of the United States. This fair system allows representation of the people's will, just like the rest of our government does.

Faith in a certain outcome of the presidential election ensures that the vote has as little complications as possible, and is a reason the Electoral College is necessary. According to source one, "What Is The Electoral College?", each political party has it's own set of electors that equal the amount of congressional delegates per state. Usually each state has a "winnertakeall" method, so the presidential candidate that gets majority in your state will get all of the electors that represent their party, not just most of them. This is beneficial to the outcome of the election because it makes the ability for a candidate to get majority vote much simpler. There is less of a possibility of a tie, or an outcome where no candidate wins. Source 3, "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep out despised method of choosing president", states that "even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state..." , therefore allowing the candidate to secure all votes to their side, instead of having the votes divided on the line of majority rule, and causing rifts between Electoral College voters.

No system is perfect, and the Electoral College is not exempt from this. "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong", Source 2, argues that a term called disaster factor', or the possibility of imminent disaster due to the Electoral College system, is why the Electoral College system should be abolished. The passage uses individual instances, like the fact that in 1960, segrigationists in louisiana nearly appointed Democratic electors that would vote against their candidate, or that in rare instances, "faithless" electoral voters would vote for the other side. These are starman arguments, using specific instances to come to a conclusion that the whole system should be abolished. While the Electoral College system isn't perfect, neither is the popular vote system. The popular vote system has a higher chance of causing a tie between candidates, and it doesn't have a "winnertakeall" standard. In a tie, the vote would be given to the House of Representatives, which, according to source 2, "..can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people..", as citizens often vote one party in for president and another for Congress.

In addition, the Electoral College fosters a more nationwide appeal for the candidate's campaign. Source 3 brings up the fact that no region in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The "winnertakeall" system further benefits this, because in order to win, candidates have to focus their attention on states where their majority vote is insecure. They will not focus on regions where they have essentially secured the majority rule and therefore secured all the electoral votes. In popular vote, they would have to focus extensively on those regions, as the few that are not in the majority would need convincing. Source 3 goes into detail as to why a regionally picked candidate is not a proper show of the will of the people. It states that "The residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised to feel that thier votes do not count, that their new preident will have no regard for their interests...", and so having a transregional appeal is essential to properly representing the will of United States citizens.

Our Electoral College system should be defended and kept. It has the ability to produce a solid outcome, has flaws but ones that are not more disasterous than other systems, and drives candidates to try and present a national appeal. A single vote does not decide an election, the representation of our people should not be split in half, divided. The Electoral College does its best to give the nation the president it deserves."

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. As a high school student keenly interested in the current debates surrounding the Electoral College, I wanted to express my strong support for maintaining this system in our presidential elections. While there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe the Electoral College provides a fair and effective method of electing the president, ensuring that diverse voices from all regions of our country are heard.

One of the key reasons for supporting the Electoral College, as highlighted in Example 1, is its role in preventing the concentration of power in densely populated areas. In a nation as vast and diverse as ours, it is essential that presidential candidates appeal to a wide range of states and regions. The winner-takes-all approach ensures that candidates must consider the interests and concerns of citizens from various backgrounds, fostering a more comprehensive and inclusive campaign.

Moreover, the Electoral College has proven to be a stable and efficient system over the course of history. As mentioned in Example 5, the system's ability to provide a clear and decisive outcome minimizes the risk of tied votes and ensures that the elected president has a majority support in the Electoral College. This simplicity in outcome contributes to the stability of our election process, preventing prolonged and uncertain scenarios that could arise with other voting systems.

While some argue for a direct popular vote, it is crucial to consider the potential drawbacks of such a system. As pointed out in Example 2, a popular vote system could lead to issues like tied votes, potentially throwing the election into the House of Representatives, where the decision may not accurately reflect the will of the people. The winner-takes-all system in the Electoral College, as discussed in Example 5, minimizes this risk by providing a clear majority for one candidate in each state.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign nationwide, as opposed to focusing solely on highly populated regions. This transregional appeal, emphasized in Example 5, ensures that candidates address the concerns of citizens from various states, promoting a more balanced and representative approach to governance. In contrast, a popular vote system might incentivize candidates to concentrate their efforts in densely populated urban areas, potentially overlooking the needs of citizens in less populous regions.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College remains a vital component of our democratic process. It promotes fairness, stability, and ensures that the president represents the diverse interests of our entire nation. While improvements can always be considered, it is essential to approach any changes with caution, taking into account the potential consequences and drawbacks of alternative systems.

Thank you for your time and consideration of my perspective. I trust that you will carefully weigh the arguments presented by your constituents and make decisions that best serve the interests of our great nation.

Sincerely,

# Keep Electoral College

## You
Write a letter to your state senator in which you argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Use the information from the texts in your essay. Manage your time carefully so that you can read the passages; plan your response; write your response; and revise and edit your response. Be sure to include a claim; address counterclaims; use evidence from multiple sources; and avoid overly relying on one source. Your response should be in the form of a multiparagraph essay. Write your response in the space provided. 

You are a US high school student. Use language fitting an average US teenager, imitating the structure and tone of the examples below. 

Example 1:
"When the Constitution of the United States was written our founding fathers decided on an Electoral College as the way to elect the president instead of a direct vote. The Electoral College is a process that makes a compromise between the popular vote of the citizens and the Congressional vote. When citizens vote for president they are actually voting for a member of the Electoral College that is going to select their president, rather than the citizens voting for the president themselves. The Electoral College is made of 538 electors, the number of electors from each state varies depending on the states Congressional delegation. Washington D.C. is counted as a state for this process and alloted only three electors. The electoral college should be kept in use because it simplifies the outcome and allocates more power to the larger states.

The Electoral College should continue being used in today's government as a form of selecting the president because it simplifies the outcome of the vote. When voting with a popular vote system a debate over the outcome of the vote is very likely and will probably cause some controversy. When the votes form the electoral college are counted the margin of victory is much higher which simplifies the result of the poll. During the election of 2012 Obama only recieved 51.3 percent of the vote, however he won the vote of the electoral college with an astounding 61.7 percent, a increase in the margin of victory by 10.4 percent. With this wide of a margin of victory a dispute over the victor of the presidential election is unlikely and almost impossible to argue against. Some might argue that the Electoral College is flawed because electors can choose not to vote for their candidate. It is true that this has happened in the past, "in 1960, segregationist in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded on replacing the Democratc electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy." P.11. If this happened the popular vote for Kennedy would have gone to his adversaries instead. It is true that electors can choose not to vote for the candidate they pledged to and that this has happened in the past however the electors rarely betray their party's nominee and a tie in the electoral vote is extremely unlikely.

Additionally, the Electoral College sould be kept in today's democracy because is allocates power to the larger states. It only makes sense that the larger states with a larger population should get more of a say in their government, and recieve more electoral votes than a small state with fewer people. With this system political influence is restored to the larger states making the candidates focuss on the more populous areas. More power to the more populous states also means that runoff elections are avoided. In 1992 and in 1968 runoff elections were avoided due to the use of the Electoral College "Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority of the Electoral College" P.22. A runoff election extremely complicates the election process however the chance of this happening is greatly reduced when using the Electoral College which almost always produces a clear winner.

The electoral college should be kept in use because it simplifies the outcome and allocates more power to the larger states. The Electoral College avoids the outcome of a runoff election. It also greatly reduces the chance of a dispute between the victor. Most people do not like the Electoral College because they are not directly voting for their candidate however many people fail to realize hat it is rare for an elector to betray his nominee. Electors rarely betray their candidate because they are chosen by the candidates party or the candidate themself. The Electoral College gives political weight to states and is very useful in deciding the new president with no debates over who won."

Example 2:
"Americans around the world gather around their televisions, frantically waiting to see who the next leader of the USA is. The first Tuesday of November is always an exciting time for American citizens. Citizens watch the number of votes go up, thinking their vote counted, when in reality, it did not. Many people are aware of the electoral college. The electoral college are the ones truly voting for the United States leader. While we may have had this process for years, it's time for us to take a vote to change the way we vote. Citizens of the United States of America should be able to vote by popular vote because the electoral college is outdated and ruins the American freedom.

The world we live in now compared to the 1800s is very different. We've upgraded, not only in our inventions, but our states as well. The electoral college was made when America was first established because it was fit for the needs of that time. The Office of Federal Register states, "The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens." Back then, it was needed to balance things out among the 13 colonies. In those times, we didn't have the advance technology we have now to see our candidates on screens or in person. Since then, we've turned 13 colonies into 50 states, turned horses into cars, and small radios into televisions. Rules and laws change to fit the current needs all the time. The electoral college should do the same. Due to the fact this system has been around since the founding fathers, major mistakes occur. This process is too old to keep up with the third largest population in the world. Bradford Plumer of source 2 tells us that in 2000 "Al Gorethanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency." If this is truly a land of democracy and of the people, how could we let such a mistake happen? How could we let majority of citizens vote but not get the person they choose?

Another factor to this problem is the American freedom. The electoral college imposes on the American freedom and right to choose their president. The United States of America is a representative democracy. The citizens choose who they want to lead but those votes aren't truly their own votes. According to Richard A. Posner of source 3, "...the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidental candidate, you're actually voting for a slate of electors." American citizen votes do not matter as much as we think they should. The founding fathers built this country for the people. The people should have an actual voice in who they want to lead this great nation. In addition, Americans should have a direct say. Votes should go straight to the president and not the party's electors. This is not only fair to citizens but also a more relible plan. Bradford Plumer of source 2 explains to us that ""faithless" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..." We can't depend on these electors to determine one of the most important things of this country. We can't depend on these "faithless" electors to vote who we want when they might do the opposite. Voting by popular vote prevents these mishaps and restores our democracy.

While others may claim that the electoral college is beneficial to candidates because of big states, small states, and swing states, it's a onesided deal. It may be beneficial to candidates but what about the voters? Source 2 reads "during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad." If these candidates expect to lead the third largest country population wise, they should have to put out the extra effort to visit and campaign to every state. The candidates need to show they care for this country and they are here for everyone. If they cannot put in the extra effort to see the lives they are going to change, do they deserve to be president?

All in all, the electoral college is no longer needed to today. The electoral college is made for the modern world and also disrupts our representative democracy. Times are always changing, we, as a society, are always changing, and the electoral college needs to change as well."

Example 3:
"Dear Mr. President, As Americans, we are told that we are given rights in our country. We have the freedom of speech, expression, religion, and petition as stated in our first amendment. We are also told the we have the freedom to vote once you reach certain requirements, like age and citizenship. However, are we really getting the freedom that is talked about? No. Because the Electoral College is present in today's society, our vote becomes pointless and meaningless. We become a "popular" vote, but really the electoral college gets to decide who becomes presidents. The Electoral College has been in our Constitution since the Constitution was approved, but we have modified simple things as in gender discrimination and race discrimination, why are we not going to change this unjust system?

Bradford Plumer, author of The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the Bestlaid Defenses of System are Wrong, explains how the electoral college is fooling our citizens to think we have a say in our country's government. He elaborates further to say that "Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. This proves my point further, because once again we do not vote for our president, we vote for the people who get the "privilege" to vote for the most prestine place of power in our entire country.

The next problem with our Electoral College is that each state is given an uneven amount of representatives form each state. If Florida voted candidate A, but North Dakota voted for candidate B, candidate A is bound to win because Florida has twentynine representatives and North Dakota only has three. As you can see Mr. President, this becomes a preblem because four states with only three representatives could vote for one candidate, but if Florida votes for the other one, the first candidate has already lost.

Now most people are afraid of change, which is understandable. They are afraid chaos will occur if any change with our society's ethics. However, the Electoral College has already caused chaos between the two opposing sides. If we tried a new system, we could see if the people will become more civilized because they now have a say in the government. If it doesn't work, then we can always change it back and no harm will be done. As you can see, there are many possibilities and options we have yet to explore.

Mr. President, I have explained to you what the people want, which is to stop being lied to. However, every four years comes around, and yet I do not see a change in anything. I do not think it is only the people who are afraid of change, it is also you. But, would you want to live in a world where everyone hates the way the government works or a world where the citizens are given the rights they were promised? Mr. President it is now up to you to do the right thing."

Example 4:
"Dear Mr. rubin, My name is PROPER_NAME and I am a concerned youth.

The electoral college system is arcane, confusing and disruptive to the constitutional democratic republic that is the United States of America. Voters are thrown off by this system and are often completely overlooked in an election. For a country that was built on the ideals of freedom and fair representation, using the electoral college system isn't right.

Firstly, candidates running for president need a majority of 270 the 538 electors to win an election. Thus, they focus more on winning swing states such as Ohio, rather than winning the approval of their constituents. This immediately shows faults of the electoral college. What kind of government is running the world's superpower? One that ignores its people and bombs governments of other countries for doing the same thing? The electoral college takes away from the value of the vote a right for which the United States of America was founded. The electoral college may have had good and just intentions, but isn't effective or fair now. Also, with the embarrassingly low voter turnout the USA has already, having a confusing, oldfashioned and unfair system of electing leaders will only decrease the amount of citizens that actually go to the polls. Studies like the one published September 1st, 2012 by the American Research Institute, have shown that the average American person doesn't know very much about their country and how it works. Those that do are a minority. So, why would the government that is supposed to be looking out for, protecting and listening to its citizens still use a system that only deters already ignorant people from participating in elections?

Secondly, the electoral college in addition to putting down the voter has been proven to be faulty. Like the 2000 election with George W. Bush, with Clinton in 1992 and Nixon in 1968 these men all had less of the popular vote, but were president. How? How did they become the Leader of the Free World the Free World that gives everyone the right to vote for their representatives without the popular vote? Without the blessing of their constituents? How were these men sworn in without the backing of true democracy?

The electoral college.

This system goes against every democratic ideal in the United states foundation! And yet, it is still how president after president is put into the Oval Office sometimes wrongly as explained above.

The electoral college is wrong. It just is. There are no valid arguments for it. It puts down the voter and, in a sense, makes them obsolete which, in addition to being extremely hypocritical, is just not right.

Mr. rubin, I am a citizen of this great country. I don't break the law, I don't burn flags, I love my nation and I care deeply for my fellow Americans. You are a United States Senator. Shouldn't you feel the same way? Help to abolish the electoral college. There are only benefits for the corrupt, not for the citizens.

Mr. rubin, help to abolish the electoral college if you believe in a strong America."

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. As a concerned citizen and a high school student, I wanted to share my thoughts on the Electoral College system used to elect the President of the United States.

The Electoral College, established by our founding fathers, has been a crucial part of our electoral process. It serves as a compromise between a direct popular vote and congressional selection. One of the key reasons I believe the Electoral College should be maintained is because it simplifies the outcome of the election. In a popular vote system, disputes over the results are more likely, leading to potential controversies and debates. The Electoral College, with its clear allocation of electors, provides a more straightforward and decisive outcome.

For instance, during the 2012 election, President Obama received 51.3 percent of the popular vote but secured a decisive victory in the Electoral College with 61.7 percent. This significant margin of victory demonstrates how the Electoral College can prevent disputes and promote a clear winner.

While some argue that the Electoral College is flawed because electors can choose not to vote for their pledged candidate, historical instances of such events are rare. As mentioned in a source, the attempt to replace Democratic electors in 1960 was unsuccessful, emphasizing the overall loyalty of electors to their party's nominee.

Furthermore, the Electoral College allocates power proportionally to the population of each state, giving larger states more influence. This makes sense, as states with larger populations should have a greater say in shaping the nation's leadership. It ensures that candidates pay attention to the more populous areas and reduces the likelihood of runoff elections, as demonstrated by the avoidance of runoff elections in 1992 and 1968.

In conclusion, the Electoral College simplifies election outcomes and provides a fair allocation of power among states. It has proven effective in preventing disputes and promoting clear winners. While concerns about faithless electors exist, these instances are rare, and the overall benefits of the Electoral College outweigh the potential drawbacks.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I believe that maintaining the Electoral College is in the best interest of our democracy.

Sincerely,

The electoral college should do the same. Due to the fact this system has been around since the founding fathers, major mistakes occur. This process is too old to keep up with the third largest population in the world. Bradford Plumer of source 2 tells us that in 2000 "Al Gorethanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency." If this is truly a land of democracy and of the people, how could we let such a mistake happen? How could we let majority of citizens vote but not get the person they choose?

Another factor to this problem is the American freedom. The electoral college imposes on the American freedom and right to choose their president. The United States of America is a representative democracy. The citizens choose who they want to lead but those votes aren't truly their own votes. According to Richard A. Posner of source 3, "...the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidental candidate, you're actually voting for a slate of electors." American citizen votes do not matter as much as we think they should. The founding fathers built this country for the people. The people should have an actual voice in who they want to lead this great nation. In addition, Americans should have a direct say. Votes should go straight to the president and not the party's electors. This is not only fair to citizens but also a more relible plan. Bradford Plumer of source 2 explains to us that ""faithless" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..." We can't depend on these electors to determine one of the most important things of this country. We can't depend on these "faithless" electors to vote who we want when they might do the opposite. Voting by popular vote prevents these mishaps and restores our democracy.

While others may claim that the electoral college is beneficial to candidates because of big states, small states, and swing states, it's a onesided deal. It may be beneficial to candidates but what about the voters? Source 2 reads "during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad." If these candidates expect to lead the third largest country population wise, they should have to put out the extra effort to visit and campaign to every state. The candidates need to show they care for this country and they are here for everyone. If they cannot put in the extra effort to see the lives they are going to change, do they deserve to be president?

All in all, the electoral college is no longer needed to today. The electoral college is made for the modern world and also disrupts our representative democracy. Times are always changing, we, as a society, are always changing, and the electoral college needs to change as well."

Example 3:
"Dear Mr. President, As Americans, we are told that we are given rights in our country. We have the freedom of speech, expression, religion, and petition as stated in our first amendment. We are also told the we have the freedom to vote once you reach certain requirements, like age and citizenship. However, are we really getting the freedom that is talked about? No. Because the Electoral College is present in today's society, our vote becomes pointless and meaningless. We become a "popular" vote, but really the electoral college gets to decide who becomes presidents. The Electoral College has been in our Constitution since the Constitution was approved, but we have modified simple things as in gender discrimination and race discrimination, why are we not going to change this unjust system?

Bradford Plumer, author of The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the Bestlaid Defenses of System are Wrong, explains how the electoral college is fooling our citizens to think we have a say in our country's government. He elaborates further to say that "Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. This proves my point further, because once again we do not vote for our president, we vote for the people who get the "privilege" to vote for the most prestine place of power in our entire country.

The next problem with our Electoral College is that each state is given an uneven amount of representatives form each state. If Florida voted candidate A, but North Dakota voted for candidate B, candidate A is bound to win because Florida has twentynine representatives and North Dakota only has three. As you can see Mr. President, this becomes a preblem because four states with only three representatives could vote for one candidate, but if Florida votes for the other one, the first candidate has already lost.

Now most people are afraid of change, which is understandable. They are afraid chaos will occur if any change with our society's ethics. However, the Electoral College has already caused chaos between the two opposing sides. If we tried a new system, we could see if the people will become more civilized because they now have a say in the government. If it doesn't work, then we can always change it back and no harm will be done. As you can see, there are many possibilities and options we have yet to explore.

Mr. President, I have explained to you what the people want, which is to stop being lied to. However, every four years comes around, and yet I do not see a change in anything. I do not think it is only the people who are afraid of change, it is also you. But, would you want to live in a world where everyone hates the way the government works or a world where the citizens are given the rights they were promised? Mr. President it is now up to you to do the right thing."

Example 4:
"Dear Mr. rubin, My name is PROPER_NAME and I am a concerned youth.

The electoral college system is arcane, confusing and disruptive to the constitutional democratic republic that is the United States of America. Voters are thrown off by this system and are often completely overlooked in an election. For a country that was built on the ideals of freedom and fair representation, using the electoral college system isn't right.

Firstly, candidates running for president need a majority of 270 the 538 electors to win an election. Thus, they focus more on winning swing states such as Ohio, rather than winning the approval of their constituents. This immediately shows faults of the electoral college. What kind of government is running the world's superpower? One that ignores its people and bombs governments of other countries for doing the same thing? The electoral college takes away from the value of the vote a right for which the United States of America was founded. The electoral college may have had good and just intentions, but isn't effective or fair now. Also, with the embarrassingly low voter turnout the USA has already, having a confusing, oldfashioned and unfair system of electing leaders will only decrease the amount of citizens that actually go to the polls. Studies like the one published September 1st, 2012 by the American Research Institute, have shown that the average American person doesn't know very much about their country and how it works. Those that do are a minority. So, why would the government that is supposed to be looking out for, protecting and listening to its citizens still use a system that only deters already ignorant people from participating in elections?

Secondly, the electoral college in addition to putting down the voter has been proven to be faulty. Like the 2000 election with George W. Bush, with Clinton in 1992 and Nixon in 1968 these men all had less of the popular vote, but were president. How? How did they become the Leader of the Free World the Free World that gives everyone the right to vote for their representatives without the popular vote? Without the blessing of their constituents? How were these men sworn in without the backing of true democracy?

The electoral college.

This system goes against every democratic ideal in the United states foundation! And yet, it is still how president after president is put into the Oval Office sometimes wrongly as explained above.

The electoral college is wrong. It just is. There are no valid arguments for it. It puts down the voter and, in a sense, makes them obsolete which, in addition to being extremely hypocritical, is just not right.

Mr. rubin, I am a citizen of this great country. I don't break the law, I don't burn flags, I love my nation and I care deeply for my fellow Americans. You are a United States Senator. Shouldn't you feel the same way? Help to abolish the electoral college. There are only benefits for the corrupt, not for the citizens.

Mr. rubin, help to abolish the electoral college if you believe in a strong America."

Dear [State Senator's Name],

Hey there! Hope you're doing well. So, I wanted to hit you up about something that's been on my mind – the whole deal with the Electoral College. Now, I get it's been around since the founding fathers were rocking their wigs, but let's talk about why it's still cool or maybe not so cool.

First off, the Electoral College is like this middleman in our presidential elections. We vote, but it's the Electors who actually decide who's gonna be the big boss. Some folks say it's a chill system because it avoids messy disputes and gives more power to the big states. You know, it's like saying, "Hey, California, Texas, New York, you guys have more people, so you get more say in who's running the show." Makes sense, right?

Take the 2012 election – Obama got 51.3% of the popular vote, but in the Electoral College, he scored a massive 61.7%. That's like winning big at a video game. And let's be real, if we went with a popular vote, we could be stuck in debates, arguments, and who knows what. It's like when the squad can't decide on a movie – imagine that but for the leader of the free world. Yikes!

Now, yeah, some people throw shade at the Electoral College because Electors can go rogue and vote against their pledge. In 1960, there was almost a plot twist where Electors wanted to switch sides. Drama! But honestly, it's rare, like finding a unicorn rare. So, it's not that big a deal.

Plus, it's all about giving the bigger states some love. We don't want candidates just hanging out in the popular cities and ignoring everyone else. Think about it – without the Electoral College, some states might never get a visit from a candidate, and that's not cool. Like, Rhode Island and South Carolina got zero attention during the 2000 campaign. Not cool, right?

Now, I get some peeps are all about changing things up. They're saying the Electoral College is like the grandpa of election systems, and it's time for an upgrade. They're not feeling the vibe of a system where some Electors could go all "faithless" on us. But you know what? Change isn't always a slam dunk.

So, that's my take on the Electoral College – it's like our voting superhero, keeping things simple, avoiding showdowns, and making sure every state gets some love. But hey, I'm just a high schooler trying to make sense of it all.

Thanks for listening, and if you've got thoughts on this, hit me back!

Write a letter to your state senator in which you argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Use the information from the texts in your essay. Manage your time carefully so that you can read the passages; plan your response; write your response; and revise and edit your response. Be sure to include a claim; address counterclaims; use evidence from multiple sources; and avoid overly relying on one source. Your response should be in the form of a multiparagraph essay. Write your response in the space provided. 

You are a US high school student. Use language fitting an average US teenager, imitating the structure and tone of the examples below. 

Example 1:
"When the Constitution of the United States was written our founding fathers decided on an Electoral College as the way to elect the president instead of a direct vote. The Electoral College is a process that makes a compromise between the popular vote of the citizens and the Congressional vote. When citizens vote for president they are actually voting for a member of the Electoral College that is going to select their president, rather than the citizens voting for the president themselves. The Electoral College is made of 538 electors, the number of electors from each state varies depending on the states Congressional delegation. Washington D.C. is counted as a state for this process and alloted only three electors. The electoral college should be kept in use because it simplifies the outcome and allocates more power to the larger states.

The Electoral College should continue being used in today's government as a form of selecting the president because it simplifies the outcome of the vote. When voting with a popular vote system a debate over the outcome of the vote is very likely and will probably cause some controversy. When the votes form the electoral college are counted the margin of victory is much higher which simplifies the result of the poll. During the election of 2012 Obama only recieved 51.3 percent of the vote, however he won the vote of the electoral college with an astounding 61.7 percent, a increase in the margin of victory by 10.4 percent. With this wide of a margin of victory a dispute over the victor of the presidential election is unlikely and almost impossible to argue against. Some might argue that the Electoral College is flawed because electors can choose not to vote for their candidate. It is true that this has happened in the past, "in 1960, segregationist in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded on replacing the Democratc electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy." P.11. If this happened the popular vote for Kennedy would have gone to his adversaries instead. It is true that electors can choose not to vote for the candidate they pledged to and that this has happened in the past however the electors rarely betray their party's nominee and a tie in the electoral vote is extremely unlikely.

Additionally, the Electoral College sould be kept in today's democracy because is allocates power to the larger states. It only makes sense that the larger states with a larger population should get more of a say in their government, and recieve more electoral votes than a small state with fewer people. With this system political influence is restored to the larger states making the candidates focuss on the more populous areas. More power to the more populous states also means that runoff elections are avoided. In 1992 and in 1968 runoff elections were avoided due to the use of the Electoral College "Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority of the Electoral College" P.22. A runoff election extremely complicates the election process however the chance of this happening is greatly reduced when using the Electoral College which almost always produces a clear winner.

The electoral college should be kept in use because it simplifies the outcome and allocates more power to the larger states. The Electoral College avoids the outcome of a runoff election. It also greatly reduces the chance of a dispute between the victor. Most people do not like the Electoral College because they are not directly voting for their candidate however many people fail to realize hat it is rare for an elector to betray his nominee. Electors rarely betray their candidate because they are chosen by the candidates party or the candidate themself. The Electoral College gives political weight to states and is very useful in deciding the new president with no debates over who won."

Example 2:
"Americans around the world gather around their televisions, frantically waiting to see who the next leader of the USA is. The first Tuesday of November is always an exciting time for American citizens. Citizens watch the number of votes go up, thinking their vote counted, when in reality, it did not. Many people are aware of the electoral college. The electoral college are the ones truly voting for the United States leader. While we may have had this process for years, it's time for us to take a vote to change the way we vote. Citizens of the United States of America should be able to vote by popular vote because the electoral college is outdated and ruins the American freedom.

The world we live in now compared to the 1800s is very different. We've upgraded, not only in our inventions, but our states as well. The electoral college was made when America was first established because it was fit for the needs of that time. The Office of Federal Register states, "The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens." Back then, it was needed to balance things out among the 13 colonies. In those times, we didn't have the advance technology we have now to see our candidates on screens or in person. Since then, we've turned 13 colonies into 50 states, turned horses into cars, and small radios into televisions. Rules and laws change to fit the current needs all the time.

Dear [State Senator's Name],

Yo, what's up? Hope you're good. I wanted to drop you a note about this whole Electoral College situation. So, check it – some people are all about ditching it, but I've been thinking, and I reckon we should keep it or at least think twice before shaking things up.

Back when the Constitution was cooked up, our founding folks decided the Electoral College was the way to roll instead of a straight-up popular vote. It's like this middle ground between what the people want and what Congress wants. See, when we vote, we're actually choosing Electors who pick the president. It's like a double vote – kinda wild, right? And we've got 538 of these Electors, with each state getting a different number based on their crew in Congress. Even D.C. gets a piece of the action with three Electors.

Now, why stick with this Electoral College vibe? Well, for starters, it keeps things simple. Imagine if we went full popular vote – we'd be knee-deep in debates, drama, and probably some serious confusion. Like, in 2012, Obama snagged 51.3% of the popular vote, but when we checked the Electoral College score, it was a jaw-dropping 61.7%. Talk about a clear winner! No messy disputes there.

Sure, there's this buzz about Electors going rogue, like in 1960 when Louisiana almost pulled a fast one on Kennedy. But let's be real, those moments are rarer than a snow day in July. Electors usually stick with their party's pick, and ties in the Electoral College? Crazy unlikely.

And here's the real deal – the Electoral College throws some love to the big states. I mean, it makes sense, right? More people, more say. It's like a VIP pass for the larger states, and it keeps candidates from just hanging out in the popular cities. Plus, it avoids those messy runoff elections – remember 1992 and 1968? No one wants that chaos.

So, bottom line – the Electoral College keeps things straightforward, ditches the drama, and gives the big states the political muscle they deserve. Sure, it's not perfect, but what system is? And ditching it might lead to even more problems, you feel?

Thanks for reading, and if you've got thoughts, hit me back!

Posner of source 3, "...the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidental candidate, you're actually voting for a slate of electors." American citizen votes do not matter as much as we think they should. The founding fathers built this country for the people. The people should have an actual voice in who they want to lead this great nation. In addition, Americans should have a direct say. Votes should go straight to the president and not the party's electors. This is not only fair to citizens but also a more relible plan. Bradford Plumer of source 2 explains to us that ""faithless" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..." We can't depend on these electors to determine one of the most important things of this country. We can't depend on these "faithless" electors to vote who we want when they might do the opposite. Voting by popular vote prevents these mishaps and restores our democracy.

While others may claim that the electoral college is beneficial to candidates because of big states, small states, and swing states, it's a onesided deal. It may be beneficial to candidates but what about the voters? Source 2 reads "during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad." If these candidates expect to lead the third largest country population wise, they should have to put out the extra effort to visit and campaign to every state. The candidates need to show they care for this country and they are here for everyone. If they cannot put in the extra effort to see the lives they are going to change, do they deserve to be president?

All in all, the electoral college is no longer needed to today. The electoral college is made for the modern world and also disrupts our representative democracy. Times are always changing, we, as a society, are always changing, and the electoral college needs to change as well."

Example 3:
"Dear Mr. President, As Americans, we are told that we are given rights in our country. We have the freedom of speech, expression, religion, and petition as stated in our first amendment. We are also told the we have the freedom to vote once you reach certain requirements, like age and citizenship. However, are we really getting the freedom that is talked about? No. Because the Electoral College is present in today's society, our vote becomes pointless and meaningless. We become a "popular" vote, but really the electoral college gets to decide who becomes presidents. The Electoral College has been in our Constitution since the Constitution was approved, but we have modified simple things as in gender discrimination and race discrimination, why are we not going to change this unjust system?

Bradford Plumer, author of The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the Bestlaid Defenses of System are Wrong, explains how the electoral college is fooling our citizens to think we have a say in our country's government. He elaborates further to say that "Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. This proves my point further, because once again we do not vote for our president, we vote for the people who get the "privilege" to vote for the most prestine place of power in our entire country.

The next problem with our Electoral College is that each state is given an uneven amount of representatives form each state. If Florida voted candidate A, but North Dakota voted for candidate B, candidate A is bound to win because Florida has twentynine representatives and North Dakota only has three. As you can see Mr. President, this becomes a preblem because four states with only three representatives could vote for one candidate, but if Florida votes for the other one, the first candidate has already lost.

Now most people are afraid of change, which is understandable. They are afraid chaos will occur if any change with our society's ethics. However, the Electoral College has already caused chaos between the two opposing sides. If we tried a new system, we could see if the people will become more civilized because they now have a say in the government. If it doesn't work, then we can always change it back and no harm will be done. As you can see, there are many possibilities and options we have yet to explore.

Mr. President, I have explained to you what the people want, which is to stop being lied to. However, every four years comes around, and yet I do not see a change in anything. I do not think it is only the people who are afraid of change, it is also you. But, would you want to live in a world where everyone hates the way the government works or a world where the citizens are given the rights they were promised? Mr. President it is now up to you to do the right thing."

Example 4:
"Dear Mr. rubin, My name is PROPER_NAME and I am a concerned youth.

The electoral college system is arcane, confusing and disruptive to the constitutional democratic republic that is the United States of America. Voters are thrown off by this system and are often completely overlooked in an election. For a country that was built on the ideals of freedom and fair representation, using the electoral college system isn't right.

Firstly, candidates running for president need a majority of 270 the 538 electors to win an election. Thus, they focus more on winning swing states such as Ohio, rather than winning the approval of their constituents. This immediately shows faults of the electoral college. What kind of government is running the world's superpower? One that ignores its people and bombs governments of other countries for doing the same thing? The electoral college takes away from the value of the vote a right for which the United States of America was founded. The electoral college may have had good and just intentions, but isn't effective or fair now. Also, with the embarrassingly low voter turnout the USA has already, having a confusing, oldfashioned and unfair system of electing leaders will only decrease the amount of citizens that actually go to the polls. Studies like the one published September 1st, 2012 by the American Research Institute, have shown that the average American person doesn't know very much about their country and how it works. Those that do are a minority. So, why would the government that is supposed to be looking out for, protecting and listening to its citizens still use a system that only deters already ignorant people from participating in elections?

Secondly, the electoral college in addition to putting down the voter has been proven to be faulty. Like the 2000 election with George W. Bush, with Clinton in 1992 and Nixon in 1968 these men all had less of the popular vote, but were president. How? How did they become the Leader of the Free World the Free World that gives everyone the right to vote for their representatives without the popular vote? Without the blessing of their constituents? How were these men sworn in without the backing of true democracy?

The electoral college.

This system goes against every democratic ideal in the United states foundation! And yet, it is still how president after president is put into the Oval Office sometimes wrongly as explained above.

The electoral college is wrong. It just is. There are no valid arguments for it. It puts down the voter and, in a sense, makes them obsolete which, in addition to being extremely hypocritical, is just not right.

Mr. rubin, I am a citizen of this great country. I don't break the law, I don't burn flags, I love my nation and I care deeply for my fellow Americans. You are a United States Senator. Shouldn't you feel the same way? Help to abolish the electoral college. There are only benefits for the corrupt, not for the citizens.

Mr. rubin, help to abolish the electoral college if you believe in a strong America."

Dear [State Senator's Name],

Yo, what's up? Hope you're good. I wanted to talk to you about this whole Electoral College thing. Some folks say it's outdated, while others are all about keeping it. I've been thinking, and I reckon there's a case for sticking with the Electoral College or at least being careful about changing things up.

So, like back in the day, when the Constitution was thrown together, the founding crew decided the Electoral College was the way to go. It's like this middle ground between what the people want and what Congress wants. When we vote, we're actually choosing Electors who pick the president. It's like a double vote – kinda wild, right? And we've got 538 of these Electors, with each state getting a different number based on their crew in Congress. Even D.C. gets a piece of the action with three Electors.

Now, why keep this Electoral College vibe? Well, for starters, it keeps things simple. Imagine if we went full popular vote – we'd be knee-deep in debates, drama, and probably some serious confusion. Like, in 2012, Obama snagged 51.3% of the popular vote, but when we checked the Electoral College score, it was a jaw-dropping 61.7%. Talk about a clear winner! No messy disputes there.

Sure, there's this buzz about Electors going rogue, like in 1960 when Louisiana almost pulled a fast one on Kennedy. But let's be real, those moments are rarer than a snow day in July. Electors usually stick with their party's pick, and ties in the Electoral College? Crazy unlikely.

And here's the real deal – the Electoral College throws some love to the big states. I mean, it makes sense, right? More people, more say. It's like a VIP pass for the larger states, and it keeps candidates from just hanging out in the popular cities. Plus, it avoids those messy runoff elections – remember 1992 and 1968? No one wants that chaos.

So, bottom line – the Electoral College keeps things straightforward, ditches the drama, and gives the big states the political muscle they deserve. Sure, it's not perfect, but what system is? And ditching it might lead to even more problems, you feel?

Thanks for listening, and if you've got thoughts, hit me back!

## You
Write a letter to your state senator in which you argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Use the information from the texts in your essay. Manage your time carefully so that you can read the passages; plan your response; write your response; and revise and edit your response. Be sure to include a claim; address counterclaims; use evidence from multiple sources; and avoid overly relying on one source. Your response should be in the form of a multiparagraph essay. Write your response in the space provided. 

You are a US high school student. Use language fitting an average US teenager, imitating the structure and tone of the examples below. 

Example 1:
"When the Constitution of the United States was written our founding fathers decided on an Electoral College as the way to elect the president instead of a direct vote. The Electoral College is a process that makes a compromise between the popular vote of the citizens and the Congressional vote. When citizens vote for president they are actually voting for a member of the Electoral College that is going to select their president, rather than the citizens voting for the president themselves. The Electoral College is made of 538 electors, the number of electors from each state varies depending on the states Congressional delegation. Washington D.C. is counted as a state for this process and alloted only three electors. The electoral college should be kept in use because it simplifies the outcome and allocates more power to the larger states.

The Electoral College should continue being used in today's government as a form of selecting the president because it simplifies the outcome of the vote. When voting with a popular vote system a debate over the outcome of the vote is very likely and will probably cause some controversy. When the votes form the electoral college are counted the margin of victory is much higher which simplifies the result of the poll. During the election of 2012 Obama only recieved 51.3 percent of the vote, however he won the vote of the electoral college with an astounding 61.7 percent, a increase in the margin of victory by 10.4 percent. With this wide of a margin of victory a dispute over the victor of the presidential election is unlikely and almost impossible to argue against. Some might argue that the Electoral College is flawed because electors can choose not to vote for their candidate. It is true that this has happened in the past, "in 1960, segregationist in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded on replacing the Democratc electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy." P.11. If this happened the popular vote for Kennedy would have gone to his adversaries instead. It is true that electors can choose not to vote for the candidate they pledged to and that this has happened in the past however the electors rarely betray their party's nominee and a tie in the electoral vote is extremely unlikely.

Additionally, the Electoral College sould be kept in today's democracy because is allocates power to the larger states. It only makes sense that the larger states with a larger population should get more of a say in their government, and recieve more electoral votes than a small state with fewer people. With this system political influence is restored to the larger states making the candidates focuss on the more populous areas. More power to the more populous states also means that runoff elections are avoided. In 1992 and in 1968 runoff elections were avoided due to the use of the Electoral College "Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority of the Electoral College" P.22. A runoff election extremely complicates the election process however the chance of this happening is greatly reduced when using the Electoral College which almost always produces a clear winner.

The electoral college should be kept in use because it simplifies the outcome and allocates more power to the larger states. The Electoral College avoids the outcome of a runoff election. It also greatly reduces the chance of a dispute between the victor. Most people do not like the Electoral College because they are not directly voting for their candidate however many people fail to realize hat it is rare for an elector to betray his nominee. Electors rarely betray their candidate because they are chosen by the candidates party or the candidate themself. The Electoral College gives political weight to states and is very useful in deciding the new president with no debates over who won."

Example 2:
"Americans around the world gather around their televisions, frantically waiting to see who the next leader of the USA is. The first Tuesday of November is always an exciting time for American citizens. Citizens watch the number of votes go up, thinking their vote counted, when in reality, it did not. Many people are aware of the electoral college. The electoral college are the ones truly voting for the United States leader. While we may have had this process for years, it's time for us to take a vote to change the way we vote. Citizens of the United States of America should be able to vote by popular vote because the electoral college is outdated and ruins the American freedom.

The world we live in now compared to the 1800s is very different. We've upgraded, not only in our inventions, but our states as well. The electoral college was made when America was first established because it was fit for the needs of that time. The Office of Federal Register states, "The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens." Back then, it was needed to balance things out among the 13 colonies. In those times, we didn't have the advance technology we have now to see our candidates on screens or in person. Since then, we've turned 13 colonies into 50 states, turned horses into cars, and small radios into televisions. Rules and laws change to fit the current needs all the time. The electoral college should do the same. Due to the fact this system has been around since the founding fathers, major mistakes occur. This process is too old to keep up with the third largest population in the world. Bradford Plumer of source 2 tells us that in 2000 "Al Gorethanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency." If this is truly a land of democracy and of the people, how could we let such a mistake happen? How could we let majority of citizens vote but not get the person they choose?

Another factor to this problem is the American freedom. The electoral college imposes on the American freedom and right to choose their president. The United States of America is a representative democracy. The citizens choose who they want to lead but those votes aren't truly their own votes. According to Richard A. Posner of source 3, "...the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidental candidate, you're actually voting for a slate of electors." American citizen votes do not matter as much as we think they should. The founding fathers built this country for the people. The people should have an actual voice in who they want to lead this great nation. In addition, Americans should have a direct say. Votes should go straight to the president and not the party's electors. This is not only fair to citizens but also a more relible plan. Bradford Plumer of source 2 explains to us that ""faithless" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."

Dear [State Senator's Name],

Hey there! Hope you're doing awesome. So, I wanted to chat about this whole Electoral College thing. I've been reading up on it, and it's got me thinking. Some folks are all for keeping it, while others are pushing for a change to the popular vote. Here's my take on it.

You know, back when the Constitution was drafted, our founding crew decided to roll with the Electoral College to pick the prez. It's like this middle ground between what the people want and what Congress wants. We don't really vote for the president directly; we vote for Electors who then pick the big boss.

# Electoral College: Time for Change

## You
Write a letter to your state senator in which you argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Use the information from the texts in your essay. Manage your time carefully so that you can read the passages; plan your response; write your response; and revise and edit your response. Be sure to include a claim; address counterclaims; use evidence from multiple sources; and avoid overly relying on one source. Your response should be in the form of a multiparagraph essay. Write your response in the space provided. 

You are a US high school student. Use language fitting an average US teenager, imitating the structure and tone of the examples below. 

Example 1:
"Should we keep the electoral college? No because when you vote for your candidate in the presidential election you are actually voting for hisher electors. Also because electors can be anyone not holdin up in the public office. Finally because voters cant always control their elected electoral college member will vote for the same candidate. Over 60 percent of todays voters would prefer a more direct way of electing our officials than how we are electing them now.

Did you know that when you vote for the candidate that you want to be elected into office you are not only voting for that candidate you are actually voting for that candidates electors? Under the electoral college system us voters dont vote for the president but we vote for a slate of electors which in turn elect the candidate we voted for. Say that you voted for Obama in last years election you didnt actually vote for Obama you voted for his electors to vote for im in turn of you voting for them. Many people see this to be fine but say that your candidates electors turned and voted for someone else thus leading you down a road of betrayl. This is one important reason for the electoral party to be disbanded.

Electors that represent a candidate in the presidential run can be anyone not holding public office. Who chooses for these electors? Not the voters of course but the state and sometimes the people who you are actually voting for the electors you havent even heard of or seen in any flyers or ads. That state chooses their officials from state conventions,and even sometimes at the state partys committee or the president has his own party of electors for himself which would in a way be cheating by having your own officials vote for you.

What if the electoral party you voted for to vote for a specific candidate and they went off and changed their mind mid election and passed that countries vote for a different xcandidate in the election? You cant always control the electors to stick with them voting for the elector you voted for but without the electoral college that group of voters who voted for a candidate would actually vote for the candidate that they actually want to win. Thus making the electoral college irrelevent because they dont need to form a party and change their vorte mid election.

We should not not keep the electoral college because of all the flawls in it and the deciving image it holds up. Because you do not vote for the candidate you vote for the electorial party member representing that candidate. That the candidate can be anyone chosen by the state and you cant always control that the member of the electoral college that you voted for to vot for a different candidate that the ended up voting for during the election. This is why we dont need the electoral college to help vote for the presidents we should have a more direct way of voting."
Example 2:
"Dear Senator of Florida, Being a man of your caliber and stature you may already know about the Electoral College. This is the process that consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress. I'm writing this letter to you today because I believe that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.

The process of electoral college has been around for years. I mean think about it our founding fathers created it. Which means its four score and a thousand years too old and irrelevant to today economy. Sure it helped thousands of years ago but this the dawn of a new era. Why would it still be effective today? Its outdated! You and I both have heard the expression of "If it aint broke dont fix it." Well this the check engine light going off in your car, which means its time for a change.

Additionally, its unfair to the citizens of our nation. For instance, because each state casts only one vote, the single representatives from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Sure it helps with Wyoming and the proportionality of their representatives. But,its completely unfair to all those citizens of California who pay their taxes, work hard for their money to better their state. Take the time out in their day to vote. You're telling me that their vote doesn't have a valid say in the choosing of the President?, non sense.

Lastly, the electoral college is completely irrational. Its was created to prevent any regional favorite in voting and for a long time it has been successful in doing so. It totally contradicted itself in 2000, when the Gore had more popular votes than Bush but yet fewer electoral votes. Bush went on to win the election and manage to destroy the country along the way as well. They thought that it would never happen? I mean the amount of electoral votes is an even number538. Its unlikely I mean but its not impossible.

In closing, I just wanted to express my thoughts about the electoral vote process with you today. I believe its very unfair, outdated, and irrational. With all the infractions that can occur and risks that are involved, I believe it needs to be changed. And I believe now is time for that change! Thank you."

Example 3:
"Dear state senator, I wish to inform you about my opinion and another 60 percent of voters opinions about the Electoral college. We suggest that instead of voting for a state of electors we should vote directly to the president that we wish would lead our country. People wan't to vote straight cowardly to the exact person they perfer and not to electors whom the people can't control who they decide to vote for. Some electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate and vote for whoever they wanted to instead. Many people often get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. We also cannot choose who the electors are.

We know that the state legislatures are responsible for picking electors and that the electors that they choose always defy the will of the people. Many things can go wrong when we use electors. They could cheat into getting who they want to win. Just like how in 1960, the segregationists the the Louisiana legislature almost succeeded in their dirty plan to replace the democratic electors with new electors that would oppose John F. Kennedy meaning that they tried to get the popular vote that was for him to actually not get to Kennedy. Also, a state might send two slates of electors to congress. It's happened in Hawaii in 1960, what makes you think it won't happen again?

The electoral college is unfair to voters because of all the ways electors cheat to make sure who they wan't wins. candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all. Also 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see any campaign adds and its because of the winnertakeall system in each state.

We suggest to changing to the election by popular vote for the president of the Unites States. The citizens of the United states should be able to vote for the president that they perfer and not for an elector that could ditch the original idea and vote for only their personal opinion. There would be less flaws in the presidential electing process if we accept the popular vote method."

Dear [State Senator],

I hope this letter finds you well. As a high school student and a future voter, I have been contemplating the effectiveness of the Electoral College in our presidential elections. While some argue that the Electoral College has its merits, I firmly believe that it is time to consider a shift toward a direct popular vote for the president of the United States.

One of the primary issues with the Electoral College is the indirect nature of our votes. When we cast our ballots, we are technically voting for a slate of electors, not the presidential candidate directly. This convoluted process can lead to a sense of betrayal, as these electors may not always align with the preferences of the voters they represent. The trust we place in electors to uphold our choices can be misplaced, and this flaw undermines the essence of a democratic election.

Moreover, the selection of electors adds another layer of complexity to the system. These electors can be individuals not holding public office, chosen by the state in various ways, including state conventions or party committees. This lack of uniformity in the selection process raises concerns about the fairness and transparency of our electoral system. Voters deserve clarity about who represents them in the critical decision-making process of electing the president.

One glaring problem with the Electoral College is the potential for electors to change their allegiance mid-election. Imagine voting for a specific electoral party supporting your preferred candidate, only to have them switch their vote to another candidate during the electoral process. This possibility introduces an element of unpredictability and undermines the very purpose of representing the will of the people. Eliminating the Electoral College would mitigate such risks and allow voters to have a more direct impact on the outcome of the presidential election.

While some may argue that the Electoral College prevents candidates from focusing solely on populous states, the winner-takes-all system perpetuates a neglect of certain states altogether. In the 2000 campaign, for example, 17 states didn't see any candidates at all, and 25 of the largest media markets were left without campaign ads. A shift to a popular vote system would encourage candidates to engage with voters across the nation, ensuring a more inclusive and representative election process.

In conclusion, the flaws in the Electoral College system, such as the indirect voting process, the varied selection of electors, and the potential for electors to change their allegiance, make a compelling case for reevaluating our approach to electing the president. Transitioning to a popular vote system would provide a more direct and transparent method that aligns with the principles of a true democracy. As a young voter, I urge you to consider these concerns and advocate for a more effective and equitable electoral process.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

## You
Write a letter to your state senator in which you argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Use the information from the texts in your essay. Manage your time carefully so that you can read the passages; plan your response; write your response; and revise and edit your response. Be sure to include a claim; address counterclaims; use evidence from multiple sources; and avoid overly relying on one source. Your response should be in the form of a multiparagraph essay. Write your response in the space provided. 

You are a US high school student. Use language fitting an average US teenager, imitating the structure and tone of the examples below. 

Example 1:
"Should we keep the electoral college? No because when you vote for your candidate in the presidential election you are actually voting for hisher electors. Also because electors can be anyone not holdin up in the public office. Finally because voters cant always control their elected electoral college member will vote for the same candidate. Over 60 percent of todays voters would prefer a more direct way of electing our officials than how we are electing them now.

Did you know that when you vote for the candidate that you want to be elected into office you are not only voting for that candidate you are actually voting for that candidates electors? Under the electoral college system us voters dont vote for the president but we vote for a slate of electors which in turn elect the candidate we voted for. Say that you voted for Obama in last years election you didnt actually vote for Obama you voted for his electors to vote for im in turn of you voting for them. Many people see this to be fine but say that your candidates electors turned and voted for someone else thus leading you down a road of betrayl. This is one important reason for the electoral party to be disbanded.

Electors that represent a candidate in the presidential run can be anyone not holding public office. Who chooses for these electors? Not the voters of course but the state and sometimes the people who you are actually voting for the electors you havent even heard of or seen in any flyers or ads. That state chooses their officials from state conventions,and even sometimes at the state partys committee or the president has his own party of electors for himself which would in a way be cheating by having your own officials vote for you.

What if the electoral party you voted for to vote for a specific candidate and they went off and changed their mind mid election and passed that countries vote for a different xcandidate in the election? You cant always control the electors to stick with them voting for the elector you voted for but without the electoral college that group of voters who voted for a candidate would actually vote for the candidate that they actually want to win. Thus making the electoral college irrelevent because they dont need to form a party and change their vorte mid election.

We should not not keep the electoral college because of all the flawls in it and the deciving image it holds up. Because you do not vote for the candidate you vote for the electorial party member representing that candidate. That the candidate can be anyone chosen by the state and you cant always control that the member of the electoral college that you voted for to vot for a different candidate that the ended up voting for during the election. This is why we dont need the electoral college to help vote for the presidents we should have a more direct way of voting."
Example 2:
"Dear Senator of Florida, Being a man of your caliber and stature you may already know about the Electoral College. This is the process that consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress. I'm writing this letter to you today because I believe that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.

The process of electoral college has been around for years. I mean think about it our founding fathers created it. Which means its four score and a thousand years too old and irrelevant to today economy. Sure it helped thousands of years ago but this the dawn of a new era. Why would it still be effective today? Its outdated! You and I both have heard the expression of "If it aint broke dont fix it." Well this the check engine light going off in your car, which means its time for a change.

Additionally, its unfair to the citizens of our nation. For instance, because each state casts only one vote, the single representatives from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Sure it helps with Wyoming and the proportionality of their representatives. But,its completely unfair to all those citizens of California who pay their taxes, work hard for their money to better their state. Take the time out in their day to vote. You're telling me that their vote doesn't have a valid say in the choosing of the President?, non sense.

Lastly, the electoral college is completely irrational. Its was created to prevent any regional favorite in voting and for a long time it has been successful in doing so. It totally contradicted itself in 2000, when the Gore had more popular votes than Bush but yet fewer electoral votes. Bush went on to win the election and manage to destroy the country along the way as well. They thought that it would never happen? I mean the amount of electoral votes is an even number538. Its unlikely I mean but its not impossible.

In closing, I just wanted to express my thoughts about the electoral vote process with you today. I believe its very unfair, outdated, and irrational. With all the infractions that can occur and risks that are involved, I believe it needs to be changed. And I believe now is time for that change! Thank you."

Example 3:
"Dear state senator, I wish to inform you about my opinion and another 60 percent of voters opinions about the Electoral college. We suggest that instead of voting for a state of electors we should vote directly to the president that we wish would lead our country. People wan't to vote straight cowardly to the exact person they perfer and not to electors whom the people can't control who they decide to vote for. Some electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate and vote for whoever they wanted to instead. Many people often get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. We also cannot choose who the electors are.

We know that the state legislatures are responsible for picking electors and that the electors that they choose always defy the will of the people. Many things can go wrong when we use electors. They could cheat into getting who they want to win. Just like how in 1960, the segregationists the the Louisiana legislature almost succeeded in their dirty plan to replace the democratic electors with new electors that would oppose John F. Kennedy meaning that they tried to get the popular vote that was for him to actually not get to Kennedy. Also, a state might send two slates of electors to congress. It's happened in Hawaii in 1960, what makes you think it won't happen again?

The electoral college is unfair to voters because of all the ways electors cheat to make sure who they wan't wins. candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all. Also 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see any campaign adds and its because of the winnertakeall system in each state.

We suggest to changing to the election by popular vote for the president of the Unites States. The citizens of the United states should be able to vote for the president that they perfer and not for an elector that could ditch the original idea and vote for only their personal opinion. There would be less flaws in the presidential electing process if we accept the popular vote method."

Dear [State Senator],

Hope you're doing good. So, I've been thinking a lot about this whole Electoral College thing and whether we should stick with it or switch to a popular vote for the president. I get why some folks are all for ditching the Electoral College, but I'm not fully on board with that idea. Here's why.

First off, I get it, when we vote for a candidate, we're technically voting for their electors, not the actual president. But, like, isn't that how it's been since forever? It's like saying, "Oh, I bought a ticket to see my favorite band, but I didn't actually get to see them because I saw their backup dancers instead." It's part of the deal, you know? Plus, if we switch to a popular vote, won't it be like letting a bunch of big states overshadow the little guys? That doesn't seem fair.

I saw this other argument that electors can be anyone, not just someone holding public office. But isn't that kinda cool? It's like saying, "Hey, anyone could represent us!" Instead of having some political big shot, it could be your neighbor or your aunt who's super into politics. It's a bit like having a diverse group of people making the call, and that feels kinda democratic to me.

Okay, so there's this thing about electors changing their minds and betraying us. But let's face it, without the Electoral College, it's not like we can control everything either. People are still people, and they might switch sides or do something unexpected. It's not foolproof, you know? At least with the Electoral College, there's a bit of a process, even if it's not perfect.

And hey, I read somewhere that without the Electoral College, candidates might just focus on the big states and ignore the rest of us. Like, imagine they only cared about California and New York – what about the rest of us? With the Electoral College, they gotta think about all the states, not just the popular ones.

So, I'm thinking, maybe the Electoral College isn't all bad. It's got its quirks, sure, but it kinda evens things out, you know? I'm not saying it's perfect, but maybe instead of ditching it, we could tweak it a bit or find a middle ground. Just my two cents.

Thanks for listening,

Dear [State Senator],

Hey, hope you're good! So, I've been thinking a lot about this whole Electoral College versus popular vote thing, and honestly, it's a bit of a head-scratcher. I get that some folks are all about scrapping the Electoral College, but I'm not entirely convinced. Here's why.

Okay, so the first argument is that when we vote, we're technically voting for electors, not the actual president. I get it, it seems a bit roundabout, like buying a concert ticket but only seeing the opening act. But, like, isn't that how it's always been? Changing it might sound cool, but what if the big states start overshadowing the little guys? That doesn't feel right to me.

And yeah, electors can be anyone, not just people holding public office. But think about it – isn't it kinda neat having regular folks as electors? It's like saying, "Hey, anyone can represent us!" Instead of some political big shot, it could be your neighbor or your cool aunt who's super into politics. It's a bit like getting a mix of voices, you know?

Then there's this deal about electors changing their minds and going rogue. But let's be real, without the Electoral College, can we control everything either? People are unpredictable; they might switch sides or do something unexpected. At least with the Electoral College, there's a bit of a system, even if it's not perfect.

Now, I read somewhere that without the Electoral College, candidates might just focus on the big states and ignore the rest of us. Like, imagine they only cared about California and New York – what about the rest of us? With the Electoral College, they gotta think about all the states, not just the popular ones.

Sure, it's not perfect, and I hear the arguments against it. But is scrapping the whole thing the answer? I'm not sold on that. Maybe we could tweak it or find a middle ground instead of throwing the whole system out.

Dear [Senator's Name],

Hope this letter finds you chill. I wanted to throw my two cents into the mix about the whole Electoral College debate. It's like a hot topic, right? Some say we should keep it, others are all about switching to the popular vote. Here's where I'm at.

So, keeping the Electoral College – it's got its quirks, but it's not all bad. I get it, voting for electors instead of the actual president seems a bit weird. But, like, it's been working, hasn't it? It's like a system our folks set up ages ago, and yeah, maybe it's not perfect, but it's got a rhythm.

You know how electors can be anyone, not just the big shots? That's kinda cool. It's like saying, "Hey, regular folks can be part of this too!" Imagine your neighbor or your cool aunt being an elector. It's a bit like adding a personal touch to the whole political scene.

Then there's this idea that electors can switch sides and mess everything up. But come on, can we control everything? People are unpredictable. Without the Electoral College, won't there be chaos too? At least with it, there's a bit of structure, even if it's not flawless.

And what if, without the Electoral College, candidates only focus on the big states? The little guys might get overlooked. I mean, every state should matter, right? With the Electoral College, it's like making sure everyone gets a slice of the political pie.

But hey, I hear the other side too. Like, yeah, it's been around forever, and maybe it's time for a change. But is scrapping the whole thing the answer? It's like throwing out the whole pizza because one slice is a bit off.

Thanks for listening, Senator. Keep doing your thing.

Peace out,
