# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

In recent years, there has been a growing global movement to limit car usage, with various cities and communities experimenting with innovative approaches. The advantages of such limitations are significant, ranging from environmental benefits to improvements in public health and overall quality of life. This essay will explore the advantages of restricting car usage based on information from multiple sources.

One notable example of a community embracing a car-free lifestyle is Vauban, Germany. The experimental district, completed in 2006, has prohibited street parking, driveways, and home garages, except for a few designated areas. The result has been a remarkable shift, with 70 percent of Vauban's families choosing not to own cars, and 57 percent selling their cars to move into this car-free community. Residents report increased happiness and a reduction in stress, highlighting the personal advantages of limiting car usage (Rosenthal).

The environmental benefits of reducing car dependency are underscored by the impact on greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, passenger cars contribute to 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in certain car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can reach up to 50 percent. Efforts to make suburbs less reliant on automobiles are gaining traction globally as part of a movement known as "smart planning." Vauban serves as a pioneering example, demonstrating how communities can become more compact, accessible to public transportation, and environmentally sustainable by limiting car usage (Rosenthal).

Cities around the world are implementing measures to restrict car usage during periods of heightened pollution. Paris, for instance, enforced a partial driving ban in response to near-record pollution levels. This temporary restriction resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion, showcasing the immediate positive effects of reducing car traffic on air quality. Such interventions demonstrate the potential for short-term measures to alleviate environmental stress and encourage people to explore alternative modes of transportation (Duffer).

The success of car-free initiatives is not limited to Europe. Bogota, Colombia, has been implementing a car-free day for three consecutive years, with millions of citizens opting for alternative transportation methods. The event aims to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog, leading to improved air quality and less traffic congestion. The positive reception of this initiative in Bogota suggests that similar programs could be successful in other urban centers around the world (Selsky).

The trend of reduced car usage is not confined to specific events or experimental communities. Recent studies in the United States indicate a decline in the number of miles driven per person, with a potential shift in American behavior away from car ownership. Factors such as the rise of telecommuting, the renewal of city centers, and the availability of car-sharing programs contribute to this cultural shift. If this trend continues, it could have significant positive implications for reducing carbon emissions and improving overall environmental sustainability (Rosenthal).

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are multifaceted, encompassing personal well-being, environmental sustainability, and the overall quality of life in urban and suburban areas. From Vauban's car-free experiment in Germany to temporary driving bans in Paris and Bogota's annual car-free day, these initiatives showcase the potential for change. As societies continue to grapple with the environmental consequences of car culture, embracing alternative modes of transportation and reimagining urban planning can pave the way for a more sustainable and healthier future.

The advantages of limiting car usage are evident in various global initiatives and experiments that redefine urban and suburban living. One exemplary case is Vauban, Germany, where residents have embraced a car-free lifestyle. The experimental district, completed in 2006, restricts street parking, driveways, and home garages. As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families choose not to own cars, citing increased happiness and reduced stress. This pioneering example represents a broader trend in Europe, the United States, and elsewhere to separate suburban life from heavy auto use through "smart planning" (Rosenthal).

The environmental benefits of such initiatives are highlighted by efforts in Paris to combat near-record pollution. In response to intense smog, the city enforced a partial driving ban, leading to a 60 percent reduction in congestion. This temporary measure not only showcased the immediate positive effects on air quality but also demonstrated the feasibility of short-term interventions to encourage alternative transportation methods. The success of such measures can serve as a model for other cities grappling with pollution and traffic issues (Duffer).

Bogota, Colombia, takes a proactive approach with its annual car-free day, where millions of citizens embrace alternative transportation methods. This initiative, now in its third year, aims to promote alternatives and reduce smog, resulting in eerily traffic-free streets. The positive response from citizens, despite occasional rain showers, underscores the potential for cultural change when it comes to transportation choices. Such events showcase the impact of community-driven initiatives in fostering a shift towards sustainable mobility (Selsky).

The shift away from car culture is also apparent in the United States, where recent studies suggest a decline in car ownership and driving. The decrease in miles driven per person since 2005, even when accounting for the recession, indicates a potential cultural shift. This decline aligns with broader societal changes, including the rise of telecommuting, city renewals, and the availability of car-sharing programs. If this pattern continues, it could have positive implications for carbon emissions and environmental sustainability, though it may pose challenges for the traditional car industry (Rosenthal).

The evolving landscape of transportation is not only driven by environmental concerns but also by changing societal attitudes, especially among the younger generation. The decrease in the percentage of young people obtaining driver's licenses and the prioritization of alternative transportation modes suggest a fundamental cultural shift. Young individuals today organize their lives around walking, public transportation, and carpooling, signaling a decreased emphasis on personal vehicle ownership. This trend, if sustained, could lead to long-term benefits for both the environment and the overall well-being of communities (Rosenthal).

In conclusion, limiting car usage emerges as a multifaceted solution with advantages ranging from environmental sustainability to improved quality of life. The global examples of Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and the changing patterns in the United States collectively highlight the potential for a cultural shift towards more sustainable and mindful transportation choices. As cities and communities continue to experiment with innovative approaches, the path toward reduced car dependency appears promising for a greener, healthier, and more connected future.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

The global movement towards limiting car usage is gaining momentum, with various examples showcasing the numerous advantages of embracing alternative transportation methods. One such pioneer is Vauban, Germany, where residents have willingly given up their cars in favor of a car-free lifestyle. The experimental district, completed in 2006, prohibits street parking, driveways, and home garages, leading to 70 percent of families not owning cars. The residents, like Heidrun Walter, attest to heightened happiness and reduced stress in this car-free community, highlighting the positive impact on individual well-being (Rosenthal).

Beyond individual happiness, the broader environmental benefits of reducing car dependency are evident in initiatives such as Paris' partial driving ban during episodes of intense smog. The ban resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion, underscoring the immediate positive effects on air quality. The enforcement of fines and impounding of vehicles sent a strong message, demonstrating the city's commitment to combatting pollution and promoting alternative transportation. Such interventions not only address environmental concerns but also highlight the importance of proactive measures to mitigate the impact of car emissions on urban air quality (Duffer).

Colombia's annual car-free day in Bogota further emphasizes the advantages of limiting car usage on a large scale. Millions of citizens actively participate in this event, promoting alternative transportation methods and reducing smog. The success of the initiative, now in its third year, extends beyond a one-day event, with long-term improvements such as increased bicycle paths, reduced traffic during rush hours, and enhanced public spaces. This holistic approach showcases the transformative impact of community-driven initiatives on both air quality and the overall urban experience (Selsky).

In the United States, there is a notable shift in behavior that aligns with global trends. Recent studies indicate a decrease in car ownership, driving, and license acquisition. This trend, if sustained, could significantly contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and environmental impact. The changing patterns in the U.S., characterized by a decline in miles driven per person, challenge the traditional notion of American car culture. The decrease in driving rates, even preceding the economic downturn, suggests a fundamental shift in societal attitudes towards personal vehicle ownership (Rosenthal).

As the world grapples with the implications of reduced car culture, the potential benefits extend beyond environmental gains. The demographic shifts in driving populations, particularly the decline in the percentage of young people obtaining licenses, indicate a broader cultural shift. This shift is influenced by factors such as the rise of telecommuting, urban renewals making suburbs less appealing, and the increased use of carpooling apps, all of which contribute to a more flexible approach to commuting. These changes, if sustained, could reshape the way communities view and utilize personal vehicles, ushering in a new era of sustainable mobility (Rosenthal).

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage extend beyond individual preferences to encompass environmental sustainability, improved air quality, and a transformative impact on urban living. The examples from Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and the changing patterns in the United States collectively illustrate the potential for a global shift towards more mindful and sustainable transportation choices. As cities and communities continue to experiment with innovative approaches, the prospect of reduced car dependency promises a greener, healthier, and more connected future.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming increasingly evident, as showcased by innovative initiatives and shifting societal attitudes worldwide. Vauban, Germany, stands as a testament to the benefits of a car-free lifestyle. In this upscale community, residents have willingly forsaken their cars, with street parking and home garages forbidden. The result is a remarkable 70 percent of families not owning cars, demonstrating the positive impact on individual well-being. Residents, such as media trainer Heidrun Walter, testify to reduced stress and heightened happiness in a community where the swish of bicycles and the laughter of children replace the distant hum of motors (Rosenthal).

Beyond individual happiness, limiting car usage contributes significantly to environmental sustainability. Paris, during episodes of intense smog, enforced a partial driving ban, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion. This bold intervention not only improved air quality but also underscored the importance of proactive measures to combat pollution. The fines imposed on violators and exceptions made for eco-friendly vehicles demonstrate the city's commitment to promoting alternative transportation and reducing emissions. These measures are crucial in addressing the environmental challenges posed by car emissions, particularly in densely populated urban areas (Duffer).

On a larger scale, Bogota, Colombia, presents a successful model of an annual car-free day. Millions of Colombians actively participate in this event, leaving the streets eerily devoid of traffic jams. The program aims to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog, with violators facing fines. The turnout, despite occasional rain showers, reflects a growing awareness and enthusiasm for sustainable mobility. Bogota's broader improvement campaign, with the construction of bicycle paths and the transformation of public spaces, illustrates the transformative impact of limiting car usage on urban living (Selsky).

The United States, too, is witnessing a cultural shift in behavior that aligns with the global trend of reducing car dependency. Studies suggest a decrease in car ownership, driving, and license acquisition, prompting researchers to ponder if America has passed peak driving.

In conclusion, limiting car usage emerges as a multifaceted solution with benefits ranging from individual well-being and reduced stress to environmental sustainability. The examples from Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and the shifting trends in the United States collectively point towards a global realization that how we move is as crucial as what we drive. As cities and communities experiment with innovative approaches, the prospect of reduced car dependency promises a greener, healthier, and more connected future for all.

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

The advantages of limiting car usage are manifold, extending from individual well-being to environmental sustainability and broader societal shifts. A notable experiment in this regard is Vauban, Germany, where residents have embraced a car-free lifestyle. In this upscale community, street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden, creating an environment where 70 percent of families do not own cars. The residents of Vauban, such as media trainer Heidrun Walter, attest to the positive impact on personal happiness, citing reduced stress and an overall improved quality of life in a community dominated by the swish of bicycles and the laughter of children (Rosenthal).

This paradigm shift is not limited to Vauban but is part of a global movement towards "smart planning." Suburbs, traditionally centered around automobiles, are now being reimagined to reduce dependency on cars. Efforts to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation are gaining traction worldwide. Initiatives like those in Vauban are challenging the conventional suburban model, with stores strategically placed within walking distance rather than in distant malls, advocating for a more sustainable and interconnected lifestyle (Rosenthal).

Environmental concerns also drive the advocacy for limiting car usage, as evidenced by Paris's response to near-record pollution. In the face of smog, the city enforced a partial driving ban, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion. Paris's measures not only improved air quality but also highlighted the need for proactive interventions to combat pollution. The fines imposed on violators and exceptions made for eco-friendly vehicles underscore the city's commitment to promoting alternative transportation modes (Duffer).

Similarly, Bogota, Colombia, has successfully implemented an annual car-free day, encouraging millions of citizens to embrace alternative transportation methods. This program aims to reduce smog and promote sustainable commuting, with violators facing fines. The event's success has led to its adoption in other countries, demonstrating a growing global awareness of the benefits of limiting car usage. Bogota's broader improvement campaign, marked by the construction of bicycle paths and the transformation of public spaces, showcases the transformative impact on urban living (Selsky).

On a larger scale, the United States is experiencing a cultural shift in behavior, with recent studies suggesting a decrease in car ownership, driving, and license acquisition. This trend, if sustained, could have profound implications for carbon emissions and the environment, given that transportation is a significant contributor to emissions. While it may pose challenges for the car industry, it aligns with broader societal changes, including telecommuting, urban renewal, and the rise of carpooling apps, all contributing to a more flexible and sustainable approach to commuting (Rosenthal).

In conclusion, limiting car usage is emerging as a global imperative with far-reaching advantages. From enhancing individual happiness and well-being to addressing environmental concerns and fostering broader societal shifts, the examples of Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and the evolving trends in the United States collectively underscore the need for a more sustainable and interconnected approach to transportation. As cities and communities worldwide experiment with innovative solutions, the prospect of reduced car dependency promises a greener, healthier, and more harmonious future for all.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

The advantages of limiting car usage are evident from various global initiatives and shifting cultural norms. One exemplary case is the German suburb of Vauban, where residents have embraced a car-free lifestyle. This experimental district, with prohibitions on street parking, driveways, and home garages, has led to a remarkable outcome: 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their cars to relocate. The residents report higher levels of happiness and reduced stress, highlighting the positive impact of minimizing car dependency on individual well-being (Rosenthal).

Moreover, the global trend toward separating suburban life from auto reliance is gaining momentum. Suburbs have traditionally been designed around automobiles, contributing significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. Efforts to adopt "smart planning" principles, as seen in Vauban and beyond, aim to create more compact and accessible suburban communities with reduced dependence on private vehicles. Placing stores within walking distance and promoting public transportation accessibility are integral components of this approach, reflecting a paradigm shift away from car-centric development (Rosenthal).

Paris provides a compelling example of the immediate benefits of limiting car usage in response to environmental challenges. During periods of intense smog, the city enforced a partial driving ban, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion and a noticeable improvement in air quality. The imposition of fines on violators and exceptions for eco-friendly vehicles underscore the city's commitment to promoting alternative transportation modes, demonstrating the tangible advantages of reducing car usage in densely populated urban areas (Duffer).

Bogota, Colombia, has taken the concept a step further with its annual car-free day, where millions of citizens actively participate in alternative modes of transportation. This initiative not only promotes sustainable commuting but also aims to reduce smog, showcasing the positive impact of limiting car usage on both individual and environmental well-being. The success of the event, coupled with Bogota's broader improvement campaign, emphasizes the transformative potential of reimagining urban spaces with reduced car dependency (Selsky).

On a broader scale, the United States is experiencing a cultural shift in driving behavior. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and obtaining fewer licenses. While economic factors like the recession played a role, societal preferences are changing, with factors such as the rise of telecommuting, urban renewal, and the popularity of carpooling apps contributing to a more flexible and sustainable approach to commuting (Rosenthal).

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are multifaceted, encompassing individual well-being, environmental sustainability, and broader societal changes. The cases of Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and the evolving trends in the United States collectively underscore the need for a more sustainable and interconnected approach to transportation. As communities worldwide experiment with innovative solutions, the prospect of reduced car dependency promises a greener, healthier, and more harmonious future for all.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

The advantages of limiting car usage are manifold and extend from individual well-being to environmental sustainability. Examining innovative experiments like Vauban, a German suburb where residents have given up cars voluntarily, sheds light on the positive outcomes of embracing a car-free lifestyle. Vauban's success, achieved by forbidding street parking, driveways, and home garages, has led to 70 percent of families not owning cars. The resultant increase in happiness and decrease in stress for residents exemplify the potential benefits of reducing car dependency on an individual level (Rosenthal).

On a larger scale, initiatives to limit car usage in response to environmental challenges are evident in Paris, where a partial driving ban was enforced during a period of intense smog. The immediate impact was a 60 percent reduction in congestion, showcasing the potential for addressing both air quality and traffic issues by limiting car usage in densely populated urban areas. The fines imposed on violators and exceptions for eco-friendly vehicles further emphasize the commitment to promoting alternative transportation modes (Duffer).

Bogota, Colombia, presents a successful model for limiting car usage through its annual car-free day. Millions of citizens actively participate in alternative modes of transportation, leaving the streets devoid of traffic jams. This program, aimed at promoting alternative transportation and reducing smog, has not only garnered significant public participation but has also led to substantial infrastructure developments, including miles of bicycle paths and improved public spaces (Selsky).

In the United States, a cultural shift in driving behavior is observed, with recent studies suggesting Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and obtaining fewer licenses. The potential for a fundamental change in car culture is significant, as reflected in the decreasing number of miles driven per person and a drop in car ownership rates. While economic factors like the recession played a role, various societal changes, such as the rise of telecommuting, urban renewal, and shared transportation services, contribute to this shift (Rosenthal; Sheller).

The benefits of limiting car usage extend beyond individual and societal well-being to environmental sustainability. The decrease in driving has implications for reducing carbon emissions, particularly in the United States, where transportation is a significant source of emissions. Additionally, the changing demographic trends, such as a drop in the percentage of young individuals obtaining a driver's license, suggest a long-term cultural shift away from traditional car ownership. This shift is already prompting rebranding efforts by major car manufacturers, recognizing the need for a broader product range beyond personal vehicles (Rosenthal; Sivak).

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are evident across various global examples. From individual happiness and stress reduction to addressing environmental challenges, such initiatives showcase the potential for a transformative shift in societal norms and urban planning. As cities and communities explore alternative transportation modes and policies, the prospect of reduced car dependency promises a greener, healthier, and more sustainable future for all.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway.

The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming increasingly evident, with innovative experiments and initiatives worldwide showcasing the potential benefits for individuals, communities, and the environment. One striking example is Vauban, an experimental suburb in Germany, where residents have voluntarily given up their cars. This upscale community, completed in 2006, has forbidden street parking, driveways, and home garages, leading to a car-free environment. The result is remarkable, with 70 percent of families in Vauban choosing not to own cars, and 57 percent selling their cars to move into the area. The positive impact on residents' well-being is palpable, as expressed by a resident, Heidrun Walter, who highlighted the reduction in stress and increased happiness associated with a car-free lifestyle (Rosenthal).

Beyond individual experiences, the move towards limiting car usage aligns with a broader global trend known as "smart planning." Suburbs like Vauban are pioneering efforts to separate suburban life from heavy auto use, acknowledging the significant role automobiles play in suburban living. With automobiles contributing to substantial greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in car-intensive areas, the need for alternative approaches to suburban development is urgent. As cities worldwide strive to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, the conventional model of spread-out homes with private garages is being reconsidered in favor of innovative urban planning that promotes sustainability and reduces dependence on cars (Rosenthal).

Paris provides another compelling case for the advantages of limiting car usage, particularly in response to environmental challenges. In the face of near-record pollution, the city enforced a partial driving ban, demonstrating a commitment to clearing the air. The results were tangible, with a 60 percent reduction in congestion and a noteworthy decrease in smog levels. While fines were imposed on violators, exceptions were made for eco-friendly vehicles, indicating a strategic push towards promoting environmentally conscious transportation. These measures underscore the potential positive impacts of restricting car usage, not only on air quality but also on traffic management (Duffer).

Colombia's capital city, Bogota, takes a proactive approach with its annual car-free day, a program that has gained popularity and is set to spread to other countries. This initiative aims to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog, leading to millions of citizens actively participating in non-motorized modes of transportation. The success of this event, despite occasional rain showers, highlights the public's enthusiasm for embracing alternative transportation methods. The long-term effects of such programs are evident in the significant infrastructure developments in Bogota, including miles of bicycle paths and improved public spaces (Selsky).

In the United States, a cultural shift in driving behavior is observed, with recent studies suggesting a decrease in car ownership, fewer licenses obtained, and a decline in the number of miles driven. This shift, coined as a potential "end of car culture," has broader implications for carbon emissions and the environment. While economic factors like the recession played a role, societal changes, such as increased telecommuting, urban renewal, and shared transportation services, contribute to this shift. Major car manufacturers are already adapting to this cultural transformation, rebranding themselves as "mobility" companies with a broader product range beyond traditional personal vehicles (Rosenthal; Sheller).

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage extend from individual well-being to broader environmental sustainability. The global examples discussed – from Vauban's car-free community to Paris' driving ban and Bogota's car-free day – collectively highlight the positive impacts of reducing car dependency. As societies evolve towards alternative transportation modes and smart urban planning, the prospect of a more sustainable, healthier, and interconnected future becomes increasingly promising.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

The movement towards limiting car usage has gained momentum globally, with various initiatives and experiments demonstrating the multiple advantages associated with reducing dependency on cars. Vauban, an experimental suburb in Germany, stands out as a pioneer in this shift. In this upscale community, residents have voluntarily given up their cars, with street parking, driveways, and home garages forbidden. Vauban's streets are entirely "car-free," except for a main thoroughfare served by a tram to downtown Freiburg. The result is impressive: 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their cars to embrace this unique lifestyle. Residents, such as Heidrun Walter, express heightened happiness and reduced stress in this car-free environment (Rosenthal).

Vauban is part of a broader global trend termed "smart planning," which seeks to separate suburban life from heavy auto use. Suburbs, traditionally reliant on automobiles, are being reimagined to be more compact and accessible to public transportation. This shift is critical in addressing environmental concerns, particularly the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. Automobiles contribute significantly to emissions, with passenger cars alone responsible for up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in certain car-intensive areas in the United States. The traditional suburban model, centered around cars, is being challenged, and new approaches emphasize proximity to public transportation and less space for parking (Rosenthal).

Paris, facing severe smog and pollution, implemented a partial driving ban to mitigate the environmental impact. During this period, even and odd-numbered license plates faced alternate-day driving restrictions, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion. The temporary ban showcased the immediate positive effects of limiting car usage on air quality. Despite some resistance and fines imposed on violators, the initiative demonstrated the feasibility and benefits of temporary restrictions for the greater good, encouraging alternative transportation and reducing the reliance on individual cars (Duffer).

Colombia's capital, Bogota, contributes to the narrative with its annual car-free day, where millions of citizens actively participate in alternative modes of transportation, leaving the streets free of traffic jams. This program, now in its third year, promotes alternative transportation and aims to reduce smog. Violators face fines, emphasizing the city's commitment to encouraging sustainable transportation practices. The success of the event has led to its adoption in other cities, emphasizing the cross-border impact of such initiatives and their potential to generate a revolutionary change in transportation habits (Selsky).

In the United States, a cultural shift in driving behavior is observed, offering hope for a more sustainable future. Studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and obtaining fewer licenses. This potential "end of car culture" has implications for carbon emissions and the environment, with transportation being a significant source of emissions. Factors such as increased telecommuting, urban renewal, and shared transportation services contribute to this shift, with major car manufacturers adapting to the changing landscape by rebranding as "mobility" companies. Demographic shifts, such as a significant drop in young individuals obtaining licenses, further reinforce the idea of a long-term cultural shift away from heavy car reliance (Rosenthal; Sheller).

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers a myriad of advantages, from environmental sustainability to improved well-being and reduced congestion. The global examples discussed, from Vauban's car-free community to Paris' driving ban and Bogota's car-free day, collectively underscore the positive impact of reducing car dependency. As societies evolve towards alternative transportation modes and smart urban planning, the prospect of a more sustainable, healthier, and interconnected future becomes increasingly promising.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

Passenger cars alone contribute to 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Recognizing the need for change, urban planners worldwide are adopting the principles observed in Vauban, emphasizing compact suburban living with enhanced accessibility to public transportation and reduced space for parking (Rosenthal).

The success of Bogota's car-free day underlines the potential for a revolutionary change in transportation habits that transcends borders (Selsky).

In the United States, a cultural shift is observed as Americans buy fewer cars, drive less, and obtain fewer licenses. The decrease in driving, which began before the economic downturn, raises fundamental questions about the peak of driving in America. If this pattern persists, it could have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, as transportation is a significant source of emissions. However, it may pose challenges for the car industry, prompting major manufacturers like Ford and Mercedes to rebrand as "mobility" companies, acknowledging the changing landscape of personal vehicle ownership (Rosenthal; Sheller).

In conclusion, limiting car usage emerges as a multifaceted solution addressing individual well-being, environmental sustainability, and urban planning. The global examples discussed underscore the positive impact of reducing car dependency, from enhancing happiness in car-free communities to combating air pollution in major cities. As societies shift towards alternative transportation modes and embrace smart urban planning, the prospect of a more sustainable, healthier, and interconnected future becomes increasingly promising.

Limiting car usage offers various advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment, as demonstrated by a series of global initiatives. In the German suburb of Vauban, residents have embraced a car-free lifestyle, with street parking, driveways, and home garages forbidden. The result is a community where 70 percent of families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their cars to move there. Residents, like Heidrun Walter, express increased happiness and reduced stress in this environment, demonstrating the positive impact on individual well-being (Rosenthal).

Beyond individual benefits, the global movement to limit car usage addresses pressing environmental concerns. In European and American suburbs, where cars are considered linchpins of middle-class living, efforts are underway to separate suburban life from excessive auto use. Automobiles contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, with passenger cars responsible for 12 percent of emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in certain car-intensive areas in the United States. Vauban, with its low-car suburban model, exemplifies the shift toward smarter planning, making suburbs more compact, accessible to public transportation, and reducing the need for extensive parking spaces (Rosenthal).

Cities worldwide are also adopting measures to limit car usage during critical times. Paris, facing severe smog and pollution, enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air. This temporary measure resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion, demonstrating the immediate positive impact of restricting car usage on air quality. The ban also encouraged alternative transportation modes and discouraged individual car use during smog episodes, showcasing the feasibility of such restrictions (Duffer).

In Bogota, Colombia, an annual car-free day has become a significant success, with millions actively participating in alternative transportation methods. The initiative, aimed at promoting alternative transportation and reducing smog, leaves the capital city's streets devoid of traffic jams. The program, in its third year, not only serves its primary purpose but also inspires other cities globally to adopt similar initiatives, emphasizing the potential for a revolutionary change in transportation habits (Selsky).

Furthermore, the shift in American behavior, as evidenced by studies suggesting a decline in car ownership, driving, and licenses, contributes to the growing trend of limiting car usage. This shift, if sustained, has beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, considering transportation is a major source of emissions. However, it may pose challenges for the car industry, leading major manufacturers like Ford and Mercedes to redefine themselves as "mobility" companies with a broader product range beyond personal vehicles (Rosenthal; Sheller).

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage extend beyond individual well-being to encompass environmental sustainability and urban planning. The global examples discussed underscore the positive impact of reducing car dependency, from enhancing happiness in car-free communities to combating air pollution in major cities. As societies shift towards alternative transportation modes and embrace smart urban planning, the prospect of a more sustainable, healthier, and interconnected future becomes increasingly promising.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

Limiting car usage offers a plethora of advantages, ranging from environmental sustainability to urban planning improvements, as illustrated by various global initiatives. In the German suburb of Vauban, residents have become suburban pioneers by voluntarily relinquishing their cars. With street parking, driveways, and home garages forbidden, Vauban's streets are entirely car-free, fostering a unique environment where 70 percent of families choose not to own cars, emphasizing the positive impact on individual well-being (Rosenthal).

The global movement to limit car usage is further evidenced by Paris, where a partial driving ban was enforced after days of near-record pollution. The immediate reduction in congestion by 60 percent showcased the effectiveness of restricting car usage in combating air pollution. The ban, which fined violators and impounded cars, demonstrated the city's commitment to addressing environmental challenges exacerbated by excessive car emissions (Duffer).

In Bogota, Colombia, an annual car-free day has become a significant success, with millions of citizens opting for alternative transportation methods. The goal is not only to reduce smog but also to promote sustainable commuting. The large turnout, despite occasional rain, underscores the enthusiasm and commitment of the community to embrace alternative transportation options (Selsky).

The cultural shift away from excessive car usage is not limited to Europe and Latin America but is also evident in the United States. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and obtaining fewer licenses. This shift, if sustained, could have profound implications for carbon emissions and the environment, as transportation is a significant contributor to emissions. Companies like Ford and Mercedes are already adapting their business strategies, recognizing the emerging trend and rebranding themselves as "mobility" companies with a broader product range beyond personal vehicles (Rosenthal).

Moreover, the decline in car ownership and driving in the United States is associated with a broader cultural shift. Factors such as the rise of the internet enabling telecommuting, the renewal of center cities making suburbs less appealing, and the increased use of cellphones and carpooling apps for flexible commuting arrangements contribute to the decreasing reliance on personal vehicles. The shift is not only seen in individual choices but is also reflected in city policies, such as New York's bike-sharing program and the proliferation of car-sharing programs nationwide (Rosenthal).

In conclusion, limiting car usage emerges as a global imperative with far-reaching benefits. From individual happiness and reduced stress to combating air pollution and fostering sustainable urban development, the advantages are evident across diverse initiatives.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

Limiting car usage offers a myriad of advantages that span environmental, economic, and societal dimensions, as demonstrated by various global initiatives. One exemplary case is the German suburb of Vauban, where residents have willingly given up their cars in favor of a car-free lifestyle. Prohibiting street parking, driveways, and home garages, Vauban encourages residents to rely on alternative modes of transportation, resulting in a remarkable 70 percent of families choosing not to own cars. The experiment in Vauban stands as a testament to the feasibility and benefits of separating suburban life from excessive auto use, aligning with the broader global movement towards "smart planning" (Rosenthal).

Furthermore, cities like Paris have implemented partial driving bans in response to environmental concerns, such as smog. The effectiveness of such measures is evident in the 60 percent reduction in congestion during the ban, showcasing the immediate positive impact of limiting car usage on air quality. The enforcement of fines and impounding of cars serves as a deterrent, emphasizing the seriousness of addressing the environmental consequences of excessive car emissions (Duffer).

The success of limiting car usage extends beyond Europe into Latin America, as seen in Bogota's annual car-free day. Millions of Colombians actively participate in this event, opting for alternative modes of transportation, from hiking and biking to taking buses. The turnout demonstrates a commitment to reducing smog and promoting sustainable commuting practices, highlighting the positive impact of such initiatives on both individual and community levels (Selsky).

In the United States, a cultural shift away from excessive car usage is underway. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and obtaining fewer licenses. This trend not only aligns with environmental goals but also poses potential challenges for the traditional car industry. Companies like Ford and Mercedes are adapting their strategies to reflect this shift, rebranding themselves as "mobility" companies with a broader product range beyond personal vehicles (Rosenthal).

The decline in car ownership and driving in the United States is associated with broader societal changes. Factors such as the rise of the internet enabling telecommuting, the renewal of center cities making suburbs less appealing, and the increased use of cellphones and carpooling apps for flexible commuting arrangements contribute to the decreasing reliance on personal vehicles. This multifaceted approach to limiting car usage encompasses changes in individual behavior, urban planning, and transportation policies, collectively contributing to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly future (Rosenthal).

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are evident across diverse global initiatives. From the individual contentment of Vauban's residents to the immediate environmental benefits witnessed in Paris and the ongoing cultural shift in the United States, the evidence supports the notion that reducing reliance on cars positively impacts communities and the planet. As the world grapples with environmental challenges, the promotion of alternative transportation and the adoption of smart planning principles emerge as crucial strategies for a more sustainable and resilient future.

The movement towards limiting car usage holds numerous advantages that extend beyond individual well-being to encompass broader environmental, economic, and societal benefits. The German suburb of Vauban serves as a paradigmatic example of a community that has embraced a car-free lifestyle. Prohibiting street parking, driveways, and home garages, Vauban encourages residents to adopt alternative modes of transportation, resulting in a remarkable 70 percent of families choosing not to own cars. Residents attested to the positive impact on their stress levels, with one noting, "When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way" (Rosenthal).

Moreover, Vauban reflects a broader trend in Europe and the United States to dissociate suburban life from heavy car reliance, aligning with the principles of "smart planning." The traditional suburban model, centered around car-dependent lifestyles, poses a significant impediment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Cars contribute up to 50 percent of emissions in some American suburbs, making alternative models like Vauban essential for environmental sustainability (Rosenthal).

Paris provides another compelling case study, where the enforcement of a partial driving ban during periods of intense smog illustrates the immediate benefits of reducing car usage. The ban resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion and a notable improvement in air quality. By targeting specific days and implementing fines for violators, the city successfully addressed both environmental concerns and traffic-related issues, showcasing the efficacy of limiting car usage in densely populated urban areas (Duffer).

Colombia's capital, Bogota, has embraced the concept of a car-free day, a program set to spread to other countries. Millions of citizens actively participated in this initiative, opting for alternative transportation methods to reduce smog and promote sustainable commuting practices. The success of the program, marked by reduced traffic congestion and increased usage of public transportation, demonstrates the positive impact of limiting car usage on a societal level (Selsky).

The trend of decreasing car ownership and driving in the United States, as highlighted by recent studies, suggests a fundamental shift in American behavior. This shift, if sustained, carries significant environmental benefits, as transportation is a major contributor to the country's emissions. The potential decline in car culture poses challenges for the traditional car industry, prompting companies like Ford and Mercedes to redefine themselves as "mobility" companies with a broader product range beyond personal vehicles (Rosenthal).

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are evident across diverse global initiatives. From the individual contentment of Vauban's residents to the immediate environmental benefits witnessed in Paris and the ongoing cultural shift in the United States, the evidence supports the notion that reducing reliance on cars positively impacts communities and the planet. As the world grapples with environmental challenges, the promotion of alternative transportation and the adoption of smart planning principles emerge as crucial strategies for a more sustainable and resilient future.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

The advantages of limiting car usage are multifaceted, encompassing environmental, economic, and societal benefits. The German suburb of Vauban serves as an exemplary model, where residents have willingly forsaken car ownership. In this experimental district, street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden, contributing to car-free streets, except for the main tram thoroughfare. The result is remarkable, with 70 percent of families in Vauban choosing not to own cars, and 57 percent even selling their cars to embrace a car-free lifestyle. Residents attest to heightened happiness, with one resident, Heidrun Walter, noting, "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way" (Rosenthal).

Vauban is part of a broader global movement known as "smart planning," aiming to dissociate suburban life from heavy car dependence. This movement recognizes that automobiles, often seen as linchpins of suburbs, contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars alone account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and can reach up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal). As such, there is a growing trend to implement Vauban-like principles globally, making suburbs more compact, accessible to public transportation, and reducing space for parking.

Paris provides a vivid illustration of the immediate benefits of limiting car usage during periods of environmental crisis. The city's partial driving ban in response to near-record pollution significantly reduced congestion by 60 percent and improved air quality. With specific measures like fines and impoundments, Paris demonstrated the effectiveness of targeted restrictions to address environmental and traffic-related concerns (Duffer).

Bogota's car-free day initiative further emphasizes the societal advantages of limiting car usage. Millions of Colombians actively participated in this program, promoting alternative transportation methods and leaving the streets devoid of traffic jams. Beyond the immediate success of the event, Bogota's broader improvement campaign, including the construction of bicycle paths and rush-hour restrictions, showcases the long-term positive impact of limiting car usage on urban development and air quality (Selsky).

In the United States, recent studies suggest a notable shift in behavior, with Americans buying fewer cars, driving less, and obtaining fewer licenses. This shift, if sustained, could have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. While it may pose challenges for the traditional car industry, it aligns with the changing preferences and priorities of the population. Factors such as telecommuting, urban renewal, and the rise of car-sharing programs contribute to this cultural shift away from car dependence (Rosenthal, Sheller).

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are evident across diverse global initiatives. From individual happiness and environmental sustainability in Vauban to targeted measures addressing pollution in Paris and large-scale societal events like Bogota's car-free day, the evidence strongly supports the adoption of measures that reduce reliance on cars. As the world faces environmental challenges and changing cultural preferences, the promotion of alternative transportation and the implementation of smart planning principles emerge as crucial strategies for a more sustainable and resilient future.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

Limiting car usage brings about a myriad of advantages that extend beyond individual preferences to have profound impacts on the environment, public health, and urban development. The German suburb of Vauban stands as a compelling example, where residents have willingly relinquished their cars to embrace a car-free lifestyle. This experimental community, designed with strict restrictions on street parking, driveways, and home garages, has achieved remarkable results. Seventy percent of Vauban's families have chosen to forgo car ownership, and 57 percent even sold their cars to relocate to this car-free haven, citing increased happiness and reduced stress associated with a car-dependent lifestyle (Rosenthal).

Vauban's success reflects a broader global trend in urban planning known as "smart planning," aiming to disentangle suburban life from heavy car dependence. Suburbs, traditionally anchored around automobiles, contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, with passenger cars alone responsible for 12 percent of emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in certain car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal). Efforts to densify cities and promote walkability are now extending to suburbs, exemplified by Vauban's low-car suburban life concept.

Paris's response to near-record pollution, as described by Robert Duffer, underscores the immediate benefits of limiting car usage during environmental crises. The city enforced a partial driving ban, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion. The measures included fines and impounding vehicles, showcasing the effectiveness of targeted restrictions to address pollution and traffic-related concerns. The experience in Paris illustrates the positive outcomes achievable through deliberate and decisive actions to limit car usage, especially in densely populated urban areas (Duffer).

Colombia's capital, Bogota, introduces the societal advantages of limiting car usage through its annual car-free day, a program set to spread to other countries. Millions of Colombians actively participated in alternative modes of transportation, leaving the city streets devoid of traffic jams. This initiative, coupled with a broader improvement campaign that includes extensive bicycle paths and rush-hour restrictions, demonstrates the positive impacts on public health, stress reduction, and air quality when car usage is limited (Selsky).

In the United States, there is a notable shift in behavior, as highlighted by Elisabeth Rosenthal's analysis of recent studies. Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and obtaining fewer licenses, suggesting a potential cultural shift away from excessive car dependence. This shift, if sustained, could significantly contribute to curbing greenhouse gas emissions, with transportation being the second-largest source of emissions in the country. While it poses challenges for the traditional car industry, it aligns with changing preferences and priorities influenced by factors such as telecommuting, urban renewal, and the rise of car-sharing programs (Rosenthal).

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage extend from individual well-being to broader societal and environmental benefits. The success stories from Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and evolving trends in the United States collectively emphasize the positive outcomes of reducing car dependence. As the world grapples with environmental challenges and shifts in cultural preferences, embracing alternatives to heavy car usage emerges as a crucial strategy for sustainable and resilient communities.

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

Limiting car usage presents numerous advantages that extend beyond personal lifestyle choices, influencing the environment, public health, and urban development. The German suburb of Vauban serves as a pioneering example, where residents have willingly abandoned their cars, and the community is designed to be entirely "car-free" (Rosenthal). Street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden, with only two parking spaces available at the edge of the development for those who choose to own a car. This intentional separation from auto use aligns with the global movement called "smart planning," emphasizing compact, accessible suburbs with reduced dependence on cars (Rosenthal).

The environmental impact of limiting car usage becomes apparent in the case of Paris, as described by Robert Duffer. Faced with near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion. The smog-clearing measures, including fines and impounding vehicles, showcase the immediate benefits of targeted restrictions to address pollution and traffic-related concerns. Paris's experience illustrates how limiting car usage can be an effective strategy during environmental crises, improving air quality and reducing congestion (Duffer).

Bogota's annual car-free day, outlined by Andrew Selsky, provides a glimpse into the societal advantages of reducing car dependency. Millions of Colombians actively embrace alternative transportation during this event, leaving the city streets free of traffic jams. The success of this initiative, coupled with a broader improvement campaign featuring extensive bicycle paths and rush-hour restrictions, highlights the positive impacts on public health, stress reduction, and air quality when car usage is limited (Selsky).

The trend of Americans buying fewer cars and driving less, as discussed by Elisabeth Rosenthal, suggests a fundamental shift in behavior with potential benefits for the environment. Recent studies indicate a decrease in the number of miles driven in the United States, presenting an opportunity to reduce carbon emissions, a significant contributor to environmental issues. While this shift may pose challenges for the traditional car industry, it aligns with changing societal preferences influenced by factors such as telecommuting, urban renewal, and the rise of car-sharing programs (Rosenthal).

In conclusion, limiting car usage emerges as a multifaceted strategy with benefits ranging from environmental conservation to public health and urban development. The diverse examples from Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and the evolving trend in the United States collectively emphasize the positive outcomes of reducing car dependence. As the world faces environmental challenges and societal preferences evolve, embracing alternatives to heavy car usage becomes crucial for sustainable and resilient communities.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

Limiting car usage offers a range of advantages, from environmental sustainability to improved public health and urban planning. One exemplary case is Vauban, a German suburb that has become a model for low-car suburban living. In Vauban, residents have voluntarily given up their cars, with street parking and driveways forbidden. Car ownership is allowed, but with only two centralized parking spaces available at the edge of the development. This intentional separation from auto use aligns with the global movement of "smart planning," aiming to make suburbs more compact, accessible to public transportation, and with less space for parking (Rosenthal).

The environmental benefits of restricting car usage are evident in the experiences of Paris during smog episodes. To combat near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion. The temporary restrictions effectively improved air quality, demonstrating the immediate positive outcomes of targeted limitations on car usage during environmental crises (Duffer).

Bogota's implementation of an annual car-free day provides another perspective on the advantages of reducing car dependency. Millions of Colombians actively embrace alternative transportation during this event, leaving the city streets free of traffic jams. This initiative, coupled with broader improvement campaigns featuring extensive bicycle paths and rush-hour restrictions, emphasizes the positive impacts on public health, stress reduction, and air quality when car usage is limited (Selsky).

In the United States, a shifting trend in behavior indicates that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. This shift, if it persists, could have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, as transportation is a significant contributor to emissions. Although it poses challenges for the traditional car industry, it aligns with changing societal preferences influenced by factors such as telecommuting, urban renewal, and the rise of car-sharing programs (Rosenthal).

In conclusion, limiting car usage presents multifaceted advantages, addressing environmental concerns, improving public health, and contributing to more sustainable urban planning. The diverse examples from Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and the evolving trend in the United States collectively highlight the positive outcomes of reducing car dependence. As the world faces environmental challenges and societal preferences evolve, embracing alternatives to heavy car usage becomes crucial for sustainable and resilient communities.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

Limiting car usage offers a myriad of advantages, as evident in the various examples provided in the source texts. One notable case is the German suburb of Vauban, where residents have willingly given up their cars. In this experimental district, street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden, promoting a car-free environment. This initiative has led to 70 percent of Vauban's families not owning cars, showcasing the success of separating suburban life from heavy auto use (Rosenthal). The Vauban model reflects a growing trend worldwide to embrace "smart planning" and create communities that are less dependent on cars, contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

Similarly, the city of Paris implemented a partial driving ban in response to near-record pollution levels. The enforcement, which restricted driving based on license plate numbers, resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion. Beyond alleviating traffic, this initiative aimed to improve air quality and reduce smog. The success of such interventions demonstrates the immediate positive outcomes of limiting car usage during environmental crises, as seen in the case of Paris (Duffer).

Colombia's capital city, Bogota, provides another compelling example of the benefits of reducing car dependency. The annual car-free day encourages millions of citizens to embrace alternative transportation methods, such as hiking, biking, skating, or taking buses. This initiative not only reduces traffic jams but also contributes to stress reduction and lower air pollution, fostering a positive impact on public health and the environment (Selsky).

Furthermore, studies indicate a shift in American behavior, with decreasing car ownership, driving, and license acquisition. The decrease in driving is not solely attributed to the economic downturn but appears to persist even in the recovery phase. If this pattern continues, it could have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, given that transportation is a significant contributor to emissions. The changing behavior, influenced by factors such as telecommuting, urban renewal, and the rise of car-sharing programs, signals a long-term cultural shift in how Americans view and use personal vehicles (Rosenthal).

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers a multitude of advantages, ranging from environmental sustainability and improved public health to more effective urban planning. The examples from Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and the evolving trend in the United States collectively highlight the positive outcomes of reducing car dependence. As the world faces environmental challenges and societal preferences evolve, embracing alternatives to heavy car usage becomes crucial for sustainable and resilient communities.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy.

The growing trend of limiting car usage presents a range of compelling advantages, as illustrated by examples from various parts of the world. In Vauban, Germany, residents have willingly embraced a car-free lifestyle, pioneering a shift away from the traditional dependence on automobiles. Vauban's innovative approach, where street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden, has resulted in 70 percent of families not owning cars, demonstrating the feasibility of separating suburban life from heavy auto use (Rosenthal).

Moreover, the case of Paris implementing a partial driving ban due to severe smog highlights the immediate environmental benefits of reducing car usage. In response to near-record pollution levels, the city enforced restrictions based on license plate numbers. This led to a 60 percent reduction in congestion, demonstrating the positive impact of limiting cars on both air quality and traffic levels. While fines and impoundments were imposed on violators, exceptions were made for eco-friendly vehicles, promoting a shift towards more sustainable transportation options (Duffer).

Colombia's capital city, Bogota, provides another insightful example through its successful annual car-free day. Millions of citizens actively participate in alternative transportation methods during this event, contributing to reduced traffic, lower air pollution, and an overall improvement in public health. The success of this program, coupled with the city's broader improvement initiatives, showcases the transformative potential of limiting car usage in creating more livable and sustainable urban environments (Selsky).

Furthermore, the evolving behavior of Americans towards car ownership, as outlined in Elisabeth Rosenthal's analysis, indicates a fundamental shift. Recent studies suggest a decline in car purchases, reduced driving, and fewer license acquisitions, potentially signaling a departure from peak driving in the United States. This shift, influenced by factors such as telecommuting, urban renewal, and the rise of car-sharing programs, holds promise for reducing carbon emissions and mitigating environmental impact. However, it also poses challenges for the traditional car industry, prompting companies to rebrand as "mobility" providers with a broader range of transportation solutions (Rosenthal).

In conclusion, limiting car usage emerges as a multifaceted solution with significant advantages. From creating innovative suburban communities like Vauban to responding to immediate environmental crises in Paris and fostering a cultural shift in Bogota, these examples collectively emphasize the positive outcomes of reducing car dependency. As the world grapples with environmental challenges and societal preferences evolve, embracing alternatives to heavy car usage becomes imperative for the creation of sustainable and resilient communities.

Limiting car usage is an imperative shift that holds numerous advantages for individuals and societies alike. This transformation is exemplified in Vauban, Germany, where residents have willingly given up their cars in favor of a car-free lifestyle. The experimental district, completed in 2006, is a testament to the growing global trend of separating suburban life from excessive auto use, embracing what is known as "smart planning" (Rosenthal). In Vauban, streets are forbidden for parking and garages, fostering a community where 70 percent of families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their cars to embrace this lifestyle. This reflects a notable improvement in the residents' well-being, with one inhabitant expressing that relinquishing her car led to reduced stress and increased happiness (Rosenthal).

Paris's response to near-record pollution provides a vivid example of the immediate environmental benefits of limiting car usage. The enforcement of a partial driving ban, based on license plate numbers, resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion and a parallel decrease in smog levels. This not only demonstrates the direct positive impact on air quality but also emphasizes the city's commitment to promoting alternative transportation methods. The initiative included exceptions for eco-friendly vehicles, hybrids, and cars with multiple passengers, indicating a strategic move towards more sustainable commuting practices (Duffer).

Beyond individual communities, Bogota, Colombia, has successfully implemented an annual car-free day, illustrating the broader societal advantages of limiting car usage. Millions of citizens actively engage in alternative transportation methods during this event, leading to reduced traffic, lower air pollution, and an overall improvement in public health. The program, part of a comprehensive improvement campaign since the mid-1990s, has transformed the city with extensive bicycle paths, reduced rush-hour traffic, and enhanced public spaces, showcasing the long-term positive impacts on urban living (Selsky).

Moreover, the changing behavior of Americans, as outlined by Elisabeth Rosenthal, presents a larger societal shift away from heavy car reliance. Recent studies indicate that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and obtaining fewer licenses. This shift has the potential to significantly reduce carbon emissions and environmental impact, given that transportation is a major source of emissions in the United States. While this cultural shift may pose challenges to the traditional car industry, it also opens doors for a more sustainable and diverse range of transportation solutions (Rosenthal).

In conclusion, limiting car usage emerges as a transformative force with multifaceted advantages, ranging from individual well-being and reduced stress to immediate environmental benefits and broader societal shifts toward sustainability. As cities and communities around the world increasingly adopt practices such as car-free zones, annual car-free days, and promoting alternative transportation methods, the collective effort to curtail car usage promises a more sustainable and resilient future.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

The advantages of limiting car usage are multifaceted, encompassing individual well-being, environmental sustainability, and the overall improvement of urban life. The German suburb of Vauban serves as an exemplary case where residents have willingly relinquished their cars, paving the way for a paradigm shift in suburban living. Streets in Vauban are strictly "car-free," with prohibitions on street parking, driveways, and home garages. This unique experiment has resulted in 70 percent of families in Vauban living without cars, and 57 percent even selling their cars to embrace this lifestyle (Rosenthal). Residents express heightened happiness and reduced stress, emphasizing the positive impact of limiting car usage on individual lives.

Furthermore, the global movement toward separating suburban life from excessive auto use, known as "smart planning," is gaining traction. Vauban's principles are influencing urban development worldwide, aiming to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, with reduced space for parking. This shift is crucial in addressing the environmental concerns associated with car emissions. Cars, especially in suburban areas, contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, making up 12 percent in Europe and up to 50 percent in some U.S. regions (Rosenthal).

The immediate environmental benefits of limiting car usage are starkly evident in Paris, where a partial driving ban was enforced to combat near-record pollution. The restriction on driving led to a 60 percent reduction in congestion and a significant decrease in smog levels. This underscores the vital role of reducing car usage in mitigating air pollution, which poses severe health risks and environmental degradation. Even in a city as iconic as Paris, the ban showcased the feasibility and positive outcomes of temporary restrictions on car usage (Duffer).

On a larger scale, Bogota's annual car-free day provides insights into the broader societal advantages of limiting car usage. Millions of Colombians actively participate in alternative transportation methods during this event, resulting in reduced traffic, lower air pollution, and improved public health. The success of this program has prompted other cities to consider similar initiatives, emphasizing the potential for a global shift towards sustainable commuting practices (Selsky).

The changing behavior of Americans, as highlighted by Elisabeth Rosenthal, adds another layer to the argument for limiting car usage. Recent studies indicate a decline in car ownership, driving, and license acquisition. If this trend persists, it could have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, as transportation is a major source of emissions in the United States. This cultural shift is prompting rebranding efforts in the automotive industry, with companies like Ford and Mercedes transitioning into "mobility" companies with a broader product range beyond personal vehicles (Rosenthal).

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage extend from individual happiness and reduced stress to global environmental sustainability. The examples of Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and the changing American behavior collectively emphasize the urgent need for a shift towards sustainable transportation practices. As cities and communities around the world adopt measures such as car-free zones, annual car-free days, and promote alternative transportation methods, the benefits of limiting car usage become increasingly apparent for the well-being of individuals and the health of the planet.

The advantages of limiting car usage are manifold, impacting individuals, communities, and the environment on both local and global scales. A compelling example is found in Vauban, Germany, where residents have become suburban pioneers by willingly relinquishing their cars. The experimental district, completed in 2006, prohibits street parking, driveways, and home garages, fostering a car-free environment. A remarkable 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, with 57 percent having sold their cars to embrace this lifestyle (Rosenthal). The reported increase in happiness and reduced stress among residents underscores the positive impact of limiting car usage on individual well-being.

The global movement toward separating suburban life from excessive auto use, known as "smart planning," is evident in Vauban's principles. This movement aims to make suburbs more compact, accessible to public transportation, and less dependent on cars. Notably, the reduction of car usage is seen as crucial in the ongoing efforts to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, particularly from passenger cars, a significant contributor to emissions in both Europe and the United States (Rosenthal).

Paris provides another stark example of the immediate environmental benefits of limiting car usage. In response to near-record pollution, the city enforced a partial driving ban, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion. The temporary measure not only improved air quality but also showcased the potential for rapid changes in transportation habits to address urgent environmental concerns (Duffer). The success of such interventions indicates that restricting car usage can be an effective strategy in combating air pollution, particularly in densely populated urban areas.

Beyond temporary measures, the annual car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, illustrates the broader societal advantages of limiting car usage. Millions of Colombians actively participate in alternative transportation methods during this event, contributing to reduced traffic, lower air pollution, and improved public health. The success of this program has prompted other cities to consider similar initiatives, emphasizing the potential for a global shift towards sustainable commuting practices (Selsky).

The changing behavior of Americans, as highlighted by Elisabeth Rosenthal, adds another layer to the argument for limiting car usage. Recent studies suggest a decline in car ownership, driving, and license acquisition. This cultural shift, possibly indicative of a long-term trend, holds promise for reducing carbon emissions and environmental impact, as transportation is a major source of emissions in the United States. Notably, major automotive companies like Ford and Mercedes are adapting to this shift by rebranding themselves as "mobility" companies with a broader focus beyond personal vehicles (Rosenthal).

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers a myriad of advantages ranging from individual happiness and reduced stress to environmental sustainability. The examples from Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and the changing American behavior collectively emphasize the urgent need for a global shift towards sustainable transportation practices. As communities worldwide explore measures such as car-free zones, annual car-free days, and promote alternative transportation methods, the benefits of limiting car usage become increasingly apparent for the well-being of individuals and the health of the planet.

Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense.

In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

Limiting car usage is a transformative and necessary step toward fostering sustainable living, reducing environmental impact, and enhancing the overall well-being of communities. Examples from around the world, such as the German suburb Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, provide compelling evidence of the advantages associated with minimizing reliance on automobiles.

Vauban, Germany, stands as a pioneering model for low-car suburban living. With strict regulations against street parking, driveways, and home garages, Vauban's streets are entirely car-free, except for a few designated areas. The result is a community where 70 percent of families have chosen to live without cars, and 57 percent even sold their cars to embrace this lifestyle (Rosenthal). The residents' testimonials echo the sentiment that life without cars brings a sense of happiness and reduced stress, emphasizing the positive impact of such a transition on individual well-being.

Beyond individual happiness, Vauban is part of a global movement known as "smart planning," aimed at decoupling suburban life from excessive automobile use. Recognizing that automobiles are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, with passenger cars responsible for up to 50 percent of emissions in some areas of the United States (Rosenthal), planners are adopting Vauban's principles worldwide. This includes making suburbs more compact, accessible to public transportation, and reducing the reliance on private vehicles for daily activities (Rosenthal).

Paris's response to near-record pollution further underscores the immediate environmental benefits of limiting car usage. Implementing a partial driving ban, the city witnessed a 60 percent reduction in congestion and a notable improvement in air quality (Duffer). Temporary measures like these demonstrate the potential for quick and effective interventions to address urgent environmental concerns, emphasizing the need to rethink our dependence on cars in densely populated urban areas.

The success of annual car-free days in Bogota, Colombia, amplifies the advantages of alternative transportation methods. Millions of Colombians actively participate in this event, leaving the streets devoid of traffic jams and promoting alternative modes of commuting. The program, part of an improvement campaign that began in the mid-1990s, has seen the construction of bicycle paths and the implementation of rush-hour restrictions, resulting in reduced traffic and lower air pollution (Selsky).

In the United States, a shift in driving behavior suggests that the country may be moving past peak driving. Recent studies indicate a decline in car ownership, driving, and license acquisition, posing potential benefits for carbon emissions and the environment (Rosenthal). Major automotive companies, including Ford and Mercedes, are already adapting to this shift by rebranding themselves as "mobility" companies with a broader focus beyond personal vehicles (Rosenthal).

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are evident across various contexts, from upscale German suburbs to bustling global cities. The environmental, individual, and societal benefits underscore the importance of transitioning toward more sustainable and car-reduced communities. As the world faces growing environmental challenges, embracing such changes becomes imperative for creating a healthier, happier, and more sustainable future.

Limiting car usage emerges as a compelling solution for myriad challenges facing modern societies, as evidenced by examples from Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and the evolving trends in the United States. Vauban, Germany, stands out as a suburban pioneer, where residents have willingly relinquished their cars in favor of a car-free lifestyle. Street parking, driveways, and home garages are strictly forbidden, fostering a community where 70 percent of families eschew car ownership, and 57 percent sold their cars to embrace this transformative way of life (Rosenthal).

The environmental benefits of reducing car dependence are vividly demonstrated in Paris, where a partial driving ban was enforced in response to near-record pollution levels. The initiative resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion, showcasing the immediate positive impact of limiting car usage on air quality and public health (Duffer). Such interventions serve as a wake-up call, highlighting the urgent need to reevaluate our reliance on automobiles, especially in densely populated urban areas.

In Bogota, Colombia, an annual car-free day has evolved into a successful program promoting alternative transportation. Millions of Colombians actively participate in this event, leaving the streets free of traffic jams and embracing eco-friendly modes of commuting like hiking, biking, skating, and public transportation. The program aims not only to reduce smog but also to alleviate stress and lower air pollution, emphasizing the multifaceted advantages of limiting car usage (Selsky).

The evolving trends in the United States further reinforce the idea that a cultural shift away from excessive car usage is underway. Studies indicate that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and obtaining fewer licenses, hinting at a potential decline in the country's peak driving era (Rosenthal). This shift, if sustained, holds promising implications for reducing carbon emissions and environmental impact, challenging traditional norms associated with car culture (Rosenthal).

The interconnected nature of these global examples underscores the importance of adopting a more sustainable approach to transportation. As planners worldwide recognize the environmental drawbacks of suburban life centered around cars, experiments like Vauban become essential models. The move toward making suburbs more compact, accessible to public transportation, and less dependent on private vehicles aligns with a broader movement called "smart planning" (Rosenthal). As we witness the transformative power of limiting car usage, from upscale German suburbs to bustling global cities, it becomes increasingly clear that embracing alternative modes of transportation is essential for a healthier, happier, and more sustainable future.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

The limitations on car usage are gaining traction worldwide, and the advantages of such measures are abundantly clear from examples in Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and the shifting trends in the United States. Vauban, Germany, epitomizes the success of a car-free community. By forbidding street parking, driveways, and home garages, Vauban encourages a lifestyle where 70 percent of families choose not to own cars, fostering a sense of well-being and happiness among its residents (Rosenthal). This experiment represents a broader global movement known as "smart planning," aiming to separate suburban life from excessive auto use (Rosenthal). The significance of this shift becomes more apparent when considering the environmental impact of traditional suburban living, where automobiles are responsible for a substantial percentage of greenhouse gas emissions, hindering efforts to combat climate change (Rosenthal).

Paris, faced with near-record pollution, took immediate action by enforcing a partial driving ban. The results were striking—congestion reduced by 60 percent, showcasing the immediate positive impact of limiting car usage on air quality (Duffer). This initiative also highlights the urgency of adopting alternative transportation methods in densely populated urban areas. The smog-related ban not only served to alleviate environmental concerns but also prompted a reconsideration of the city's reliance on diesel fuel, contributing to air pollution (Duffer).

Colombia's capital, Bogota, further illustrates the benefits of limiting car usage through its annual car-free day. Millions of Colombians actively participate, leaving the streets devoid of traffic jams and embracing eco-friendly modes of transportation, such as hiking, biking, skating, and public transit (Selsky). The success of this event has led to the construction of extensive bicycle paths, reduced rush-hour traffic, and the emergence of new recreational and commercial spaces throughout the city (Selsky). Such initiatives not only reduce air pollution but also contribute to a healthier and more vibrant urban environment.

In the United States, a cultural shift away from excessive car usage is underway, with recent studies suggesting a decline in car ownership, driving, and license acquisition (Rosenthal). If this pattern persists, it could have positive implications for carbon emissions and the environment, challenging the traditional norms associated with car culture (Rosenthal). Notably, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves as "mobility" companies, recognizing the need for a broader product range beyond personal vehicles (Rosenthal).

In conclusion, limiting car usage is not only an environmental imperative but also a catalyst for healthier, happier, and more sustainable communities. The global examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, coupled with evolving trends in the United States, underscore the multifaceted advantages of embracing alternative transportation methods. As cities worldwide grapple with issues related to pollution, congestion, and environmental sustainability, the time is ripe for a paradigm shift towards a future where cars play a diminished role in urban living.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

Limiting car usage has emerged as a crucial strategy for fostering sustainable and healthier communities, as evidenced by successful initiatives and evolving trends worldwide. Vauban, Germany, stands as a pioneering example, where residents have voluntarily given up their cars in favor of a car-free lifestyle. The community implemented strict regulations against street parking, driveways, and home garages, leading to 70 percent of families not owning cars, demonstrating a significant shift in suburban living patterns (Rosenthal).

The success of car-free initiatives extends beyond individual communities to entire cities facing environmental challenges. Paris, for instance, enforced a partial driving ban in response to near-record pollution levels. The immediate results were remarkable, with a 60 percent reduction in congestion and tangible improvements in air quality (Duffer). This proactive approach not only addressed the pressing issue of pollution but also prompted a reconsideration of policies favoring diesel over gasoline, highlighting the broader implications of limiting car usage on urban air quality (Duffer).

Car-free days, as implemented in Bogota, Colombia, further emphasize the positive impact of limiting car usage on a larger scale. Millions of Colombians actively participate in these events, embracing alternative transportation methods and leaving the streets free of traffic jams. This not only promotes eco-friendly modes of commuting but also contributes to reducing stress and air pollution (Selsky). The success of Bogota's car-free day has led to significant urban improvements, including the construction of bicycle paths, reduced rush-hour traffic, and the creation of vibrant public spaces (Selsky).

The trend of reducing car usage is not limited to specific communities or cities; it extends to a broader cultural shift, notably in the United States. Recent studies indicate a decline in car ownership, driving, and license acquisition, challenging the traditional notion of America as a prime car culture (Rosenthal). If this trend persists, it could lead to beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, making transportation, the second-largest source of emissions in the U.S., more sustainable (Rosenthal).

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are evident in the success stories of communities like Vauban, cities like Paris and Bogota, and the evolving trends in the United States. Beyond reducing pollution and congestion, these initiatives contribute to a fundamental cultural shift towards more sustainable and healthier modes of living. As the world grapples with environmental challenges, embracing alternative transportation methods and limiting car usage emerges as a crucial step towards building communities that are not only environmentally responsible but also conducive to the well-being of their residents.

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

The advantages of limiting car usage are profound, with various global examples illustrating the positive impact on the environment, urban planning, and overall well-being. One noteworthy case is the German suburb of Vauban, where residents have embraced a car-free lifestyle. The experimental district prohibits street parking, driveways, and home garages, leading to a remarkable 70 percent of families not owning cars. The success of Vauban serves as a testament to the feasibility of separating suburban life from heavy reliance on automobiles, a concept integral to the "smart planning" movement (Rosenthal).

Paris, facing severe air pollution, took decisive action by enforcing a partial driving ban. The immediate results were striking, with a 60 percent reduction in congestion and improved air quality. This move not only addressed the pressing issue of pollution but also prompted a reconsideration of policies favoring diesel over gasoline, showcasing broader implications of limiting car usage on urban air quality (Duffer).

Colombia's capital, Bogota, demonstrated the benefits of limiting car usage through an annual car-free day. Millions of Colombians actively participated, opting for alternative transportation methods, leaving the city streets devoid of traffic jams. This initiative not only promotes eco-friendly commuting but also contributes to stress reduction and lower air pollution. Bogota's success is reflected in improved urban infrastructure, including bicycle paths, reduced rush-hour traffic, and the creation of vibrant public spaces (Selsky).

The United States, often associated with a car-centric culture, is experiencing a shift in behavior. Recent studies suggest a decline in car ownership, driving, and license acquisition. This trend, if sustained, could have positive implications for carbon emissions and the environment, given that transportation is a significant contributor to emissions. The changing preferences of younger generations, such as the decreased interest in acquiring driver's licenses, reflect a cultural shift toward more sustainable modes of transportation (Rosenthal, Duffer).

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers a myriad of advantages, from mitigating environmental impact and reducing congestion to fostering healthier and more sustainable communities. The global examples of Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and changing trends in the United States collectively highlight the potential for a transformative shift in how societies approach transportation. As the world grapples with environmental challenges, embracing alternative transportation methods and limiting car usage emerges as a crucial step towards building communities that are not only environmentally responsible but also conducive to the well-being of their residents.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

The experimental district, completed in 2006, stands as a pioneer in the "smart planning" movement, aiming to separate suburban life from heavy automobile reliance (Rosenthal).

The environmental toll of excessive car usage is vividly demonstrated in Paris, where a partial driving ban was enforced to combat severe air pollution.

Notably, demographic shifts indicate a decreasing interest in car ownership among younger generations, emphasizing the potential long-term impact on American car culture (Rosenthal).

As we witness these transformative changes globally, it becomes evident that limiting car usage is not just an environmental necessity but a cultural shift with far-reaching implications. From creating car-free suburbs to implementing city-wide car bans and promoting alternative transportation methods, these initiatives collectively pave the way for more sustainable and livable communities. The future, as envisioned by visionaries like Bill Ford, involves interconnected networks of pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, and public transportation, emphasizing the need to conserve resources, reduce emissions, and improve overall safety (Rosenthal). Embracing such changes is not merely an option but a crucial step towards building a more sustainable and environmentally conscious future.

She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

The movement towards limiting car usage is gaining traction globally, with various examples showcasing the advantages of embracing alternative transportation methods. One striking case is Vauban, Germany, an upscale community where residents have willingly given up their cars. In this experimental district, street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden, and the streets are completely car-free, except for the main thoroughfare for the tram. This intentional design has resulted in 70 percent of Vauban's families not owning cars, with 57 percent selling their cars to move to this innovative suburb. The residents' testimonies emphasize the positive impact on their well-being, with one resident expressing, "When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way" (Rosenthal).

Vauban, completed in 2006, epitomizes the growing trend globally to separate suburban life from excessive auto use, part of a movement known as "smart planning." Suburbs, traditionally reliant on automobiles, are now rethinking their design principles. Vauban's success is not an isolated case; the principles are being adopted globally, aiming to make suburbs more compact, accessible to public transportation, and with reduced space for parking. This new approach envisions placing stores within walking distance, promoting a shift away from car-centric lifestyles (Rosenthal).

Paris, faced with severe smog and near-record pollution, took a bold step by enforcing a partial driving ban. This initiative resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion and improved air quality. The immediate impact on the Champs-Elysees, a typically car-laden avenue, became a symbol of the city's commitment to combat pollution. The ban targeted even and odd-numbered license plates on alternate days, with fines for violators. The move not only addressed immediate pollution concerns but also prompted a reevaluation of policies favoring diesel over gasoline and highlighted the need for alternative transportation methods (Duffer).

In Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day has become a major success, with millions of citizens opting for alternative transportation methods. This annual event aims to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog, with citizens embracing the opportunity to hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work. The event, now in its third year, has not only transformed Bogota's streets into a car-free haven but has also inspired other cities worldwide to adopt similar initiatives. Bogota's commitment to alternative transportation is part of a broader improvement campaign that includes extensive bicycle paths, reduced rush-hour traffic, and infrastructure development (Selsky).

The shift in American behavior towards fewer cars, less driving, and fewer licenses is evident in recent studies, raising the question of whether America has reached peak driving. Despite being a prime car culture, the United States has seen a decline in the number of miles driven, with indications that this trend may persist. This shift has beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, as transportation is a significant contributor to emissions. While there are concerns about the potential negative impact on the car industry, major companies are adapting to the changing landscape by rebranding themselves as "mobility" companies with a broader product range beyond personal vehicles (Rosenthal).

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are evident in diverse examples globally. From innovative suburbs like Vauban to cities like Paris and Bogota embracing car-free initiatives, the movement is not only promoting environmental sustainability but also contributing to improved well-being and quality of life. As societies reconsider their reliance on cars, these initiatives serve as inspiring models for creating more livable and sustainable communities.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

Limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for both individuals and communities, as evidenced by innovative initiatives and evolving cultural shifts across the globe. One remarkable example is Vauban, Germany, where residents of an experimental community have willingly given up their cars. In Vauban, street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden, resulting in car-free streets, except for the main tram thoroughfare and a few designated areas. This intentional design has led to 70 percent of families not owning cars, with 57 percent selling their cars to embrace this car-free lifestyle. Residents, such as Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, attested to the positive impact, stating, "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way" (Rosenthal).

The success of Vauban reflects a growing trend globally to separate suburban life from excessive automobile use, part of a movement known as "smart planning." This shift is crucial in addressing the environmental challenges posed by car-dependent suburbs. Cars are identified as a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, responsible for 12 percent in Europe and up to 50 percent in certain car-intensive areas in the United States. Planners are now extending efforts to make suburbs more compact, accessible to public transportation, and with reduced space for parking, as exemplified by Vauban's design (Rosenthal).

Paris, faced with severe smog and pollution, implemented a partial driving ban, offering another perspective on the advantages of limiting car usage. The ban targeted even and odd-numbered license plates on alternate days, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion. The smog levels in Paris, comparable to heavily polluted cities like Beijing, prompted urgent measures. The ban not only mitigated air pollution but also underscored the importance of reevaluating policies favoring diesel over gasoline and promoting alternative transportation methods. Public transit was free during the ban, emphasizing the city's commitment to reducing car dependency (Duffer).

In Bogota, Colombia, the success of a car-free day serves as a testament to the positive impact of limiting car usage on a larger scale. Millions of Colombians participated in the annual event, opting for alternative transportation methods like hiking, biking, skating, or taking buses. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog, with violators facing fines. The success of this initiative has inspired other cities worldwide to adopt similar measures, highlighting the potential for a global shift towards reducing car dependency (Selsky).

The changing behavior in the United States, as reflected in recent studies, provides another perspective on the advantages of limiting car usage. Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. The decrease in driving precedes the economic downturn, suggesting a fundamental cultural shift. This trend, if sustained, could significantly benefit the environment by reducing carbon emissions, although it poses challenges for the car industry. Major car companies are already adapting to this shift, rebranding themselves as "mobility" companies with a broader product range beyond personal vehicles (Rosenthal).

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers a multitude of advantages, from individual well-being to global environmental sustainability. Examples from Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and the United States demonstrate that embracing alternative transportation methods and reducing car dependency not only improves air quality and reduces congestion but also contributes to broader cultural shifts with long-term benefits for communities and the planet.

Limiting car usage presents numerous advantages that extend beyond individual preferences, impacting both communities and the environment. Vauban, Germany, stands out as a pioneering example of a community that has embraced a lifestyle without cars. In this upscale district, street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden, creating car-free streets, except for a main tram thoroughfare. The community's design has led to 70 percent of families forgoing car ownership, and 57 percent sold their cars to move there, emphasizing the positive impact on residents' well-being. Heidrun Walter, a Vauban resident, attests to the improvement in quality of life, stating, "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way" (Rosenthal).

The shift towards limiting car usage is not confined to specific regions but has become a global movement. Paris, facing severe smog and pollution, enforced a partial driving ban, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion. The ban targeted even and odd-numbered license plates on alternate days and showcased the immediate benefits of reducing car usage. Moreover, the implementation of such measures encourages the adoption of alternative transportation methods and emphasizes the importance of environmental consciousness (Duffer).

On a larger scale, initiatives like the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, illustrate the potential for widespread positive change. Millions of Colombians participated in this annual event, opting for alternative modes of transportation such as hiking, biking, skating, or taking buses. The success of the program, now set to spread to other countries, highlights the possibility of reducing traffic congestion, promoting alternative transportation, and addressing environmental concerns globally (Selsky).

The trend of limiting car usage is not limited to specific communities or events; it is a cultural shift observed in the United States as well. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and obtaining fewer licenses, raising questions about whether the country has reached peak driving. This shift, if sustained, holds promise for reducing carbon emissions and environmental impact. Major car companies, including Ford and Mercedes, are already adapting their business models to align with this cultural change, recognizing the need to move beyond personal vehicles (Rosenthal).

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are evident in diverse contexts, from individual experiences in communities like Vauban to the broader global impact seen in Bogota's car-free day and the evolving trends in the United States. These examples underscore the potential for positive change, emphasizing the need for a broader shift towards sustainable transportation and reduced reliance on cars. The environmental and societal benefits of such a transition make it a crucial aspect of future urban planning and development.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

Limiting car usage offers multifaceted advantages that resonate on both individual and societal levels, as evidenced by various global initiatives and shifting cultural trends. Vauban, Germany, exemplifies the transformative impact of a community embracing a car-free lifestyle. In this experimental district, street parking and home garages are prohibited, fostering a pedestrian-friendly environment. With only two designated parking spaces at the edge of the development, residents are encouraged to rely on public transportation or alternative modes of commuting. The result is a remarkable 70 percent of families in Vauban abstaining from car ownership, with 57 percent having sold their cars to join this innovative community (Rosenthal).

Beyond individual communities, cities worldwide are recognizing the necessity of reducing car usage to address pressing issues like pollution and traffic congestion. Paris implemented a partial driving ban in response to severe smog, compelling motorists to leave their cars at home on alternate days. This initiative significantly reduced congestion by 60 percent and demonstrated the immediate positive impact of limiting car usage on air quality (Duffer). Similarly, Bogota, Colombia, hosted a successful car-free day, with millions of citizens choosing alternative transportation methods, such as hiking, biking, or taking buses. This event, now expanding to other countries, underscores the potential for widespread positive change by promoting alternative transportation and reducing smog (Selsky).

In the United States, there is a noticeable cultural shift away from excessive car usage. Recent studies indicate a decline in car purchases, driving, and licenses obtained by Americans. This evolving trend prompts contemplation on whether the nation has reached peak driving. If sustained, this shift could yield significant benefits for the environment, particularly in reducing carbon emissions, as transportation remains a major contributor to the nation's greenhouse gas emissions. Major car manufacturers, such as Ford and Mercedes, are already adapting to this cultural transformation by rebranding themselves as "mobility" companies with a broader range of products beyond personal vehicles (Rosenthal).

The trend of decreasing reliance on cars is further supported by changing demographics and societal preferences. Younger generations, in particular, show a declining interest in obtaining driver's licenses and purchasing cars. Factors such as the internet facilitating telecommuting, the renewal of city centers making suburbs less appealing, and the rise of car-pooling apps contribute to this shift. Notably, the decrease in driving by young people aligns with the broader goal of reducing carbon emissions and fostering environmentally conscious behaviors (Rosenthal).

In conclusion, limiting car usage is not merely a local experiment but a global movement with far-reaching benefits. From pioneering communities like Vauban to international events like car-free days, the advantages are evident. The cultural shift away from excessive car reliance, backed by studies and global initiatives, holds promise for a more sustainable and environmentally conscious future. As the world grapples with the environmental impact of transportation, embracing alternatives and limiting car usage emerges as a crucial component of smart planning and a sustainable urban future.

In recent years, there has been a growing global movement advocating for the limitation of car usage, driven by a recognition of its environmental and societal impact. The innovative community of Vauban in Germany stands as a testament to the benefits of a car-free lifestyle. In Vauban, where street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden, 70 percent of families have chosen to forego car ownership, with 57 percent selling their cars to embrace a pedestrian-friendly environment. Residents, such as Heidrun Walter, attest to the positive shift, noting reduced stress and heightened happiness in this experimental district (Rosenthal).

This trend extends beyond individual communities to major cities grappling with pollution and congestion issues. Paris, faced with near-record pollution levels, implemented a partial driving ban to alleviate smog. The immediate impact was substantial, with congestion in the city reduced by 60 percent. Despite initial challenges and fines imposed on violators, the initiative garnered public support and demonstrated the potential of limiting car usage for environmental improvements (Duffer). Similarly, Bogota's annual car-free day has become a resounding success, with millions of Colombians embracing alternative transportation methods. The event not only reduces traffic jams but also contributes to lower stress levels and decreased air pollution, aligning with the city's broader improvement campaign (Selsky).

The United States, a historical stronghold of car culture, is also witnessing a shift in behavior. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and obtaining fewer licenses. The decline in car usage, if sustained, could have far-reaching implications for carbon emissions and the environment. As the nation contemplates whether it has reached peak driving, major car manufacturers like Ford and Mercedes are adapting to the cultural shift by rebranding themselves as "mobility" companies, recognizing a future beyond traditional personal vehicles (Rosenthal).

This cultural shift away from excessive car reliance is driven by various factors. The decline in rates of car ownership started even before the economic downturn, indicating a more fundamental change in societal attitudes. Contributing factors include the internet enabling telecommuting, the renewal of city centers making suburbs less appealing, and the rise of car-pooling apps facilitating flexible commuting arrangements. Such changes align with the goal of reducing carbon emissions and fostering environmentally conscious behaviors (Rosenthal, Sivak).

In conclusion, limiting car usage emerges as a global imperative with multifaceted advantages. From the upscale community of Vauban to major cities like Paris and Bogota, the evidence suggests that embracing alternative transportation methods and curbing excessive car reliance contribute to happier, healthier communities and a sustainable future. As individuals, communities, and nations grapple with the environmental impact of transportation, the movement towards limiting car usage emerges as a crucial component of smart planning and a sustainable urban future.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

The advantages of limiting car usage are multifaceted, encompassing environmental, social, and economic benefits. The German suburb of Vauban serves as a pioneering example, where residents have voluntarily given up their cars, leading to a unique car-free community. In Vauban, street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden, encouraging 70 percent of families to forgo car ownership altogether. This shift has resulted in reduced stress and increased happiness among residents, exemplified by Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, who expressed contentment with the car-free lifestyle (Rosenthal).

The global recognition of the environmental impact of cars has prompted major cities to take decisive action. Paris, for instance, implemented a partial driving ban in response to near-record pollution levels. During this ban, which targeted motorists with even or odd-numbered license plates on alternate days, congestion in the city decreased by 60 percent. This significant reduction demonstrated the immediate positive effects of limiting car usage on air quality and public health. Such interventions are crucial in combating the detrimental impact of car emissions on the environment, as evidenced by Paris's smog-clearing measures (Duffer).

Beyond individual communities and major cities, the success of car-free initiatives extends to entire countries. In Bogota, Colombia, millions of citizens actively participated in a car-free day, leaving the streets eerily devoid of traffic jams. This annual event, aimed at promoting alternative transportation and reducing smog, has seen increasing support. The success of Bogota's program has spurred interest from other countries, with the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay, expressing enthusiasm about the revolutionary change being generated by such initiatives (Selsky).

Moreover, a fundamental shift in American behavior suggests that the United States may be moving away from its historical reliance on cars. Recent studies indicate that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and obtaining fewer licenses. If this trend persists, it could have significant implications for carbon emissions and the environment, given that transportation is a major contributor to the country's emissions. Companies like Ford and Mercedes are already adapting to this cultural shift by rebranding themselves as "mobility" companies, anticipating a future beyond traditional personal vehicles (Rosenthal).

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are evident across various scales, from individual communities like Vauban to major cities such as Paris and Bogota, and even on a national level in the United States. The environmental benefits, coupled with positive impacts on health and well-being, underscore the importance of embracing alternative transportation methods and moving towards a future where personal vehicle ownership is more mindful and sustainable. The ongoing cultural shift away from excessive car reliance signifies a positive trajectory toward a more environmentally conscious and interconnected urban landscape.

Limiting car usage presents a myriad of advantages, ranging from environmental sustainability to improvements in public health and urban planning. Vauban, a German suburb, stands as an exemplar of the benefits associated with reducing car dependency. Residents of Vauban have willingly given up their cars, with street parking, driveways, and home garages being forbidden in this experimental district. As a result, a significant majority of Vauban's families, 70 percent to be precise, do not own cars, contributing to a more peaceful and harmonious living environment. The experiment in Vauban aligns with the global trend of separating suburban life from excessive auto use, promoting a concept known as "smart planning" (Rosenthal).

The environmental repercussions of heavy car usage are evident in the case of Paris, where a partial driving ban was enforced to combat near-record pollution levels. The ban significantly reduced congestion, providing a glimpse of the positive impact of limiting car usage on air quality and overall urban well-being. The success of such interventions is crucial in the face of escalating greenhouse gas emissions and the detrimental health effects associated with smog. Paris's temporary driving ban not only alleviated environmental concerns but also prompted discussions about alternative modes of transportation and the need for policy changes favoring cleaner energy sources (Duffer).

Further illustrating the advantages of car-free initiatives, Bogota, Colombia, has successfully implemented a car-free day, inspiring millions to adopt alternative means of transportation. The annual event aims to promote sustainable commuting options and reduce smog, resulting in an environment-friendly transformation of the city. Bogota's efforts, marked by the construction of extensive bicycle paths and other infrastructure improvements, exemplify the positive outcomes of prioritizing alternative transportation methods. The large turnout and enthusiasm observed during the car-free day indicate a growing awareness and acceptance of the benefits associated with limiting car usage (Selsky).

In the United States, a cultural shift away from excessive car reliance is underway, as indicated by declining car ownership, reduced driving, and fewer license acquisitions. This shift aligns with President Obama's ambitious goals to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The potential long-term cultural change has implications for carbon emissions and environmental sustainability. Societal factors, such as the rise of the Internet, the renewal of center cities, and advancements in mobile technology, contribute to this shift by making alternative commuting arrangements more feasible. Changes in driving patterns among the younger population, as observed in decreased rates of obtaining licenses, further emphasize the evolving cultural perspective toward personal vehicle ownership (Rosenthal).

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are evident on various scales, from individual communities like Vauban to major cities such as Paris and Bogota, and even on a national level in the United States. The environmental benefits, coupled with positive impacts on health and well-being, underscore the importance of embracing alternative transportation methods and moving towards a future where personal vehicle ownership is more mindful and sustainable. The ongoing cultural shift away from excessive car reliance signifies a positive trajectory toward a more environmentally conscious and interconnected urban landscape.

And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

Limiting car usage presents a range of compelling advantages, as evidenced by innovative initiatives and cultural shifts around the world. One notable example is Vauban, Germany, where residents have embraced a car-free lifestyle. In this experimental district, street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden, and only two large garages at the edge of the development accommodate car owners. As a result, an impressive 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their cars to move to this community. The residents attested to the positive impact on their well-being, citing reduced stress and a happier lifestyle. Vauban represents a growing global trend of separating suburban life from excessive auto use, emphasizing the importance of "smart planning" to create more compact and accessible communities (Rosenthal).

The environmental and health advantages of limiting car usage are evident in Paris, where a partial driving ban was enforced in response to near-record pollution levels. The ban significantly reduced congestion, leading to a 60 percent decrease in traffic, and demonstrated the immediate positive effects on air quality. Paris's proactive measures, including fines for violators and exemptions for environmentally friendly vehicles, highlight the city's commitment to reducing smog and improving the well-being of its residents. Such interventions underline the importance of addressing the environmental impact of excessive car usage, especially in densely populated urban areas (Duffer).

Colombia's capital, Bogota, takes a different approach with its successful annual car-free day. Millions of Colombians participate by hiking, biking, skating, or taking buses to work, resulting in streets devoid of traffic jams. This event, which has spread to other countries, aims to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Bogota's long-term improvement campaign includes the construction of extensive bicycle paths, reducing rush-hour traffic, and enhancing public spaces. The city's commitment to sustainable commuting options and infrastructure improvements showcases the positive impact of limiting car usage on both the environment and the overall urban experience (Selsky).

In the United States, a cultural shift away from excessive car reliance is observed, as reflected in President Obama's goals to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Recent studies indicate a decrease in car ownership, reduced driving, and fewer licenses acquired. This shift, if sustained, could have significant positive implications for carbon emissions and the environment. Societal changes, such as the rise of the Internet, the renewal of center cities, and advancements in mobile technology, contribute to this shift by making alternative commuting arrangements more feasible. The decrease in driving among the younger population suggests a fundamental change in attitudes toward personal vehicle ownership, emphasizing a long-term cultural shift (Rosenthal).

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are multifaceted, encompassing environmental sustainability, public health, and enhanced urban living. The global examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, along with the cultural shift observed in the United States, collectively underscore the importance of reevaluating our reliance on cars. These initiatives and changes represent steps toward creating more mindful and sustainable transportation systems, contributing to a healthier, more environmentally conscious future.

Limiting car usage offers numerous advantages that span environmental, health, and urban planning domains. The German suburb of Vauban serves as a striking example, where residents have voluntarily given up their cars, leading to a car-free community. In this experimental district, street parking and driveways are forbidden, and car ownership is limited to two large garages at the edge of the development. This innovative approach has resulted in 70 percent of Vauban's families not owning cars, with 57 percent selling their cars to embrace this sustainable lifestyle. Residents report decreased stress and heightened happiness, showcasing the positive impact of reducing car dependency on individual well-being (Rosenthal).

The environmental benefits of limiting car usage are evident in the case of Paris, where a partial driving ban was enforced to combat near-record pollution levels. The ban resulted in a significant reduction in congestion, with a 60 percent decrease in traffic. The move also demonstrated the immediate positive effects on air quality, with smog levels comparable to notoriously polluted cities like Beijing. Paris's initiative highlights the correlation between reduced car usage and improvements in air quality, emphasizing the necessity of curbing car dependency to mitigate environmental impact (Duffer).

Colombia's capital, Bogota, contributes to the global movement of limiting car usage through its annual car-free day. Millions of Colombians participate in activities such as hiking, biking, and taking buses, leaving the streets free of traffic jams. The event aims to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog, emphasizing the positive impact of embracing sustainable commuting options. Bogota's long-term improvement campaign, including extensive bicycle paths and rush-hour restrictions, showcases the transformative effects of limiting car usage on urban development and overall well-being (Selsky).

In the United States, a cultural shift away from excessive car reliance is observed, aligning with President Obama's goals to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Recent studies indicate a decrease in car ownership, reduced driving, and fewer licenses acquired. This shift could have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. Societal changes, such as advancements in technology and urban renewal, contribute to this shift, fostering a more sustainable and mindful approach to transportation (Rosenthal).

In conclusion, the multifaceted advantages of limiting car usage are evident in the global initiatives and cultural shifts highlighted in the passage set. From creating car-free communities in Germany to combating pollution in Paris and promoting sustainable transportation in Bogota, these examples underscore the positive impact of reducing car dependency on individual well-being and the environment.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

Limiting car usage presents a myriad of advantages, as demonstrated by innovative initiatives and cultural shifts around the world. One notable example is the German suburb of Vauban, where residents have willingly forsaken car ownership to create a car-free community. In this experimental district, street parking and driveways are prohibited, and cars can only be parked in large garages at the edge of the development, emphasizing the shift towards more sustainable living. This groundbreaking approach has resulted in 70 percent of Vauban's families not owning cars, promoting a sense of happiness and reduced stress among residents (Rosenthal).

Moreover, the environmental benefits of limiting car usage are underscored by the case of Paris. In response to near-record pollution, the city enforced a partial driving ban, resulting in a remarkable 60 percent reduction in congestion. Paris's initiative aimed to combat smog and improve air quality, showcasing the immediate positive effects of reducing car dependency on urban environments. The enforcement of restrictions, fines, and impoundments serves as a tangible example of the commitment required to address the environmental impact of excessive car usage (Duffer).

Colombia's capital, Bogota, contributes to the global movement by annually hosting a car-free day, encouraging millions of residents to adopt alternative modes of transportation. The event, part of a broader improvement campaign, has transformed the city by constructing extensive bicycle paths, reducing traffic during rush hours, and creating more pedestrian-friendly spaces. The success of Bogota's initiative demonstrates the feasibility of limiting car usage, emphasizing the positive impact on air quality, stress reduction, and overall well-being (Selsky).

In the United States, a cultural shift away from excessive car reliance is observed, aligning with President Obama's goals to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and obtaining fewer licenses, indicating a potential peak in driving. This shift has implications for both the environment and the automotive industry. While it may contribute to lowering carbon emissions, it challenges the traditional business model of car manufacturers, prompting them to consider a broader range of products beyond personal vehicles (Rosenthal).

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are evident in the diverse examples provided. From creating car-free communities to combating pollution in major cities and promoting sustainable transportation, these initiatives underscore the positive impact on individual well-being and the environment. As societies around the world explore innovative approaches to urban planning and transportation, the shift towards reduced car dependency emerges as a crucial component of a sustainable and healthier future.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

The advantages of limiting car usage are multifaceted, as evidenced by diverse initiatives and cultural shifts worldwide. One pioneering example is Vauban, Germany, an upscale community where residents have voluntarily abandoned car ownership. In this car-free district, street parking, driveways, and home garages are prohibited, encouraging sustainable living and reducing stress among residents. The success of Vauban reflects a broader global trend towards "smart planning," aiming to separate suburban life from excessive auto use (Rosenthal).

Paris, a global city facing severe pollution, implemented a partial driving ban to combat smog. The immediate impact was a 60 percent reduction in congestion and a notable improvement in air quality. The initiative also highlights the environmental consequences of car dependency, with smog levels in Paris rivalling those in Beijing, a city notorious for its pollution. This demonstrates the urgent need to limit car usage to mitigate the harmful effects of vehicular emissions (Duffer).

Colombia's capital, Bogota, contributes to the cause through an annual car-free day. This event, now spreading to other countries, encourages millions of residents to adopt alternative transportation methods, such as hiking, biking, or using buses. The success of this initiative, despite occasional rain showers, emphasizes the willingness of citizens to participate in reducing traffic congestion, stress, and air pollution. It serves as a model for other cities seeking sustainable urban development (Selsky).

In the United States, a cultural shift away from excessive car reliance is observed, aligning with President Obama's goals to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Recent studies indicate a decline in car purchases, driving frequency, and license acquisition. This shift, whether influenced by economic factors or cultural changes, presents an opportunity to reduce carbon emissions and improve environmental sustainability. However, it also poses challenges to the traditional car industry, prompting companies to diversify their products beyond personal vehicles (Rosenthal).

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers a range of benefits, from creating car-free communities to combatting pollution and promoting sustainable transportation. The examples of Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and the evolving trends in the United States collectively illustrate the positive impact on individual well-being, environmental health, and urban development. As societies worldwide explore innovative approaches to transportation and urban planning, reducing car dependency emerges as a crucial element in fostering a sustainable and healthier future for all.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

The advantages of limiting car usage are manifold, with examples from around the world showcasing the positive impact on both the environment and individuals. One notable case is Vauban, Germany, where residents have willingly embraced a car-free lifestyle. In this upscale community, conventional parking and home garages are forbidden, encouraging a shift towards alternative modes of transportation. The result is a community where 70 percent of families do not own cars, fostering a sense of well-being among residents who express relief from the stress associated with car ownership (Rosenthal).

Paris, facing severe pollution, implemented a partial driving ban during days of near-record smog. The immediate impact was a significant reduction in congestion, with a 60 percent decrease in the capital's traffic. The smog levels, rivaling those of Beijing, emphasized the consequences of excessive car usage on air quality. This initiative not only improved the environmental conditions but also prompted exceptions for environmentally friendly vehicles, such as plug-in cars and hybrids, signaling a shift towards promoting eco-friendly transportation (Duffer).

Colombia's capital, Bogota, took a proactive approach with its annual car-free day, encouraging millions to adopt alternative transportation methods. This event, now spreading to other countries, resulted in eerily traffic-free streets, showcasing the potential of alternative modes of transportation in reducing congestion and promoting cleaner air. The success of this initiative is complemented by the city's long-term improvement campaign, which includes extensive bicycle paths and restrictions on rush-hour traffic (Selsky).

In the United States, there is evidence of a cultural shift away from excessive car reliance. Recent studies indicate a decline in car purchases, driving frequency, and license acquisition, suggesting a potential "peak driving" scenario. This shift, influenced by factors such as economic constraints and changing societal attitudes, could have positive implications for carbon emissions and the environment. However, it also poses challenges to the traditional car industry, prompting companies to redefine themselves as "mobility" entities with a broader product range beyond personal vehicles (Rosenthal).

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers tangible benefits, from creating sustainable communities to combating pollution and reducing stress. The global examples of Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and the evolving trends in the United States collectively emphasize the positive impact on both individual well-being and the broader environment. As societies worldwide explore innovative approaches to transportation and urban planning, reducing car dependency emerges as a crucial element in fostering a sustainable and healthier future for all.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

Limiting car usage offers a multitude of advantages, contributing to both individual well-being and environmental sustainability. The case of Vauban, Germany, serves as an exemplary model where residents have willingly abandoned car ownership, transforming their community into an experimental car-free district. In Vauban, street parking, driveways, and home garages are prohibited, encouraging a reliance on alternative modes of transportation such as trams and bicycles. As a result, a staggering 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, with 57 percent having sold their cars to embrace this unique lifestyle (Rosenthal).

The environmental impact of reducing car usage is further underscored by the actions taken in Paris to combat smog. In response to near-record pollution, the city enforced a partial driving ban, leading to a 60 percent reduction in congestion. Parisians faced fines for violating the ban, but the initiative showcased a tangible reduction in air pollution. Notably, exceptions were made for environmentally friendly vehicles, emphasizing the importance of promoting eco-friendly transportation methods (Duffer).

Colombia's capital, Bogota, annually implements a car-free day, aiming to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The program, now spreading to other countries, results in millions of Colombians opting for hiking, biking, skating, or using buses, transforming the city streets into a traffic-free haven. Despite occasional rain showers, the turnout is substantial, indicating a positive reception to the initiative. Bogota's long-term improvement campaign, including the construction of extensive bicycle paths and rush-hour restrictions, complements the success of the car-free day (Selsky).

In the United States, there is evidence of a cultural shift away from excessive car reliance. Studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and acquiring fewer licenses. This shift, often attributed to economic constraints and changing societal attitudes, has raised questions about whether the country has reached "peak driving." While the decrease in driving can be linked to the recession, there are indications that the trend is persisting into the recovery period. If this pattern continues, it could have positive implications for carbon emissions and the environment, although it may pose challenges to the traditional car industry (Rosenthal).

In conclusion, limiting car usage emerges as a global trend with widespread benefits. The experiences in Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and the evolving trends in the United States collectively demonstrate that reducing car dependency positively impacts both individual lifestyles and the broader environment. As societies increasingly explore innovative approaches to transportation and urban planning, the shift towards sustainable alternatives becomes imperative for fostering a healthier and environmentally conscious future.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

Limiting car usage presents numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment, as evidenced by various global initiatives. The upscale community of Vauban in Germany stands out as a suburban pioneer where residents have willingly forsaken car ownership. Streets in this experimental district are entirely "car-free," with strict regulations against street parking and driveways. As a result, an impressive 70 percent of Vauban's families choose not to own cars, and 57 percent even sold their cars to embrace this lifestyle. The experiment reflects a broader trend across Europe and the United States to separate suburban life from heavy auto use, a movement termed "smart planning" (Rosenthal).

One of the key motivations behind limiting car usage is the environmental impact of automobiles. Suburbs, often reliant on cars, contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. For instance, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and can go up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Recognizing the urgency to address climate change, initiatives like Vauban are adopting a new approach to suburban living, emphasizing compactness, accessibility to public transportation, and reduced space for parking. This shift challenges the traditional suburban model centered around car dependency (Rosenthal).

Paris, facing intense smog and pollution, implemented a partial driving ban to combat air quality issues. During this period, congestion in the city reduced by 60 percent, showcasing the immediate positive impact of limiting car usage. The ban, which fined violators, saw participation from millions of residents who opted for alternative transportation methods. Notably, exceptions were made for environmentally friendly vehicles, highlighting a growing emphasis on eco-friendly transportation solutions (Duffer).

The success of car-free initiatives extends beyond Europe to Latin America, where Bogota in Colombia annually implements a car-free day. Millions of Colombians actively participate in activities such as hiking, biking, skating, or using buses during this event, transforming the bustling city into a traffic-free environment. This initiative aims to promote alternative transportation methods and reduce smog, emphasizing the potential for widespread adoption of sustainable practices (Selsky).

In the United States, there is a noticeable cultural shift away from excessive car reliance. Studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and obtaining fewer licenses, challenging the long-standing reputation of the U.S. as a car culture. The decrease in driving, predating the economic downturn, indicates a fundamental shift in behavior. If this trend persists, it could have positive implications for carbon emissions and the environment, although it may pose challenges to the traditional car industry (Rosenthal, Sheller).

In conclusion, limiting car usage emerges as a global trend with far-reaching benefits for individuals and the environment. The experiences in Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and the evolving trends in the United States collectively underscore the potential for a more sustainable and environmentally conscious future through reduced car dependency. As communities worldwide explore innovative approaches to transportation and urban planning, the shift towards embracing alternatives to traditional car usage becomes imperative.
