# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

EXAMPLE 1:
Have you ever wondered what will happen if we keep using cars as a means of transportation? All the air pollution, killing the atmosphere, wasting valuable resources. The future is going to be a place where we can't even breathe in air without having a mask on our heads due to smog. Going green as in limiting cars is a tremendous idea for the communities, and for the planet for various reasons. No smog in the atmosphere, greener communities, and more beneficial ways of transportation. Once you go green you will go never back.

To start off, Smog is one of the main disadvantages of owning or being in heavily populated area where they use cars frequently. Smog is when the cars emit there gases out of there tailpipe, and get trapped in the atmosphere causing people to have problems breathing. Articles in the city of Paris in France said that they had to ban cars due to the smog in the atmosphere. They hit a near record of air pollution and stopped people form using there cars on certain days to clear the smog from the atmosphere. On that five day period of the intensifying smog actually rivaled the place of Beijing, China which is known to be one of the most polluted cities in the world. Once the smog cleared they rescind the ban of car usage only to be a the same place there are going to be now if they keep on using cars.

In addition, cities around the world are creating new communities where they are not allowed to use cars. In Vauban, Germany the residents there are in a set up where they cannot use cars in there everyday life. 70 percent of the people over there do not own a car and 57 percent sold their car just to move into the community. "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way," said Heidrum Walter, a resident of the city. Other places in the world like in Bogota, Colombia is in a program that they cannot use cars in there life. The life were they are no cars is a good life for a community and for everyone else.

Lastly, the end of transportion is not done, but people are finding new ways of transportation. Newer ways of transportation has stared in New York they have a bikesharing program has skyrocketed. As well as car pooling since only one car or van is being used rather than 4 of 5 cars it is more efficient. People in the United states are using these ideas in there everyday life. Sutdies have shown that are less likely to get their drivers liscense and get a car. The world will be in a better place without car usage.

To summerize, limiting car usage is a extrodinary idea to make the world a better place. To cease the air pollution of smog, to make greener communities, and to make efficent ways of transportation.

EXAMPLE 2:
Cars have been around since the 1800's and have been popular ever since. Although, in recent years the number of cars bought and licenses attained have been dropping. Car usage has also dropped, which is a good thing. Because of limited car usage, people are helping the environment and benefiting themselves.

Cars emit pollution which harm our health and the environment's health.

"...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States." Cars make up a large amount of the emissions that do harm to the environment. When car usage is limited, less people drive, which in turn limits pollution. "... but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars are owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities." Again we see that cars are polluting our world, and it's caused by us. " it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants." Cars and other transportation are releasing emissions which are harming the environment. Limited car usage clears up the pollution which helps us and the environment stay healthy.

Many people are taking up new ways of transportation due to bans and such which are due to limits on car usage. They are taking public transportation, walking, carpooling, and so on. All of these methods of alternative transportation are beneficial. "They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends." It is better to limit car usage because not only are you helping the environment, but you're also saving money and helping yourself out. Due to the lower amount of people who buy cars because of limited car usage, car corporations are also changing. "He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.' " The way people live will benefit from lower car usage. Our lifes will be much safer. Although some people may be upset if they can't drive their cars when they want, in the long run it benefits all of the community.

As bans continued to be passed and people are choosing to walk or take the bus instead, limted car usage continues. We can see that it is beneficial to us and will help our environment in the long run. Limited car usage is truely a good thing for us and will hopefully continue.

In the evolving landscape of urban planning and environmental consciousness, the idea of limiting car usage is gaining traction as a means to foster greener, healthier communities. This shift is not merely an isolated experiment but a global movement toward what is termed "smart planning." Examples from Germany, France, and Colombia illustrate the advantages of reducing car dependency, ranging from improved air quality to the promotion of alternative and sustainable modes of transportation.

Vauban, a forward-thinking community in Germany, stands out as a pioneer in the endeavor to separate suburban life from excessive car use. With strict restrictions on parking within the neighborhood, residents have embraced a lifestyle that prioritizes walking, cycling, and public transportation. The success of Vauban demonstrates that limiting car ownership can lead to reduced tension, improved well-being, and a vibrant community where the hum of bicycles replaces the constant drone of motor vehicles.

The detrimental impact of car emissions on air quality is further underscored by the experiences of Paris. In response to alarming smog levels, the city implemented a temporary driving ban based on license plate numbers. The outcome was a remarkable 60 percent reduction in congestion and a noticeable improvement in air quality. Such interventions highlight the immediate benefits of curbing car usage in densely populated urban areas, emphasizing the urgent need to address the environmental repercussions of vehicular emissions.

Beyond Europe, Bogota, Colombia, has successfully implemented a car-free day for three consecutive years, promoting alternative transportation methods and reducing smog. This initiative, joined by other Colombian cities, serves as a model for the positive impact of limiting cars on both air quality and community engagement. Such measures not only mitigate pollution but also foster a sense of collective responsibility for environmental well-being.

In the United States, there is a growing recognition of the need to transition away from car-centric development. The decline in car ownership and driving, as noted by studies, suggests a potential shift in American behavior. This trend aligns with President Obama's goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, emphasizing that a decrease in driving can contribute significantly to achieving these environmental targets.

While the prospect of limiting car usage may face initial resistance, the long-term benefits are evident. As societal attitudes evolve and new generations prioritize alternative transportation methods, the traditional car culture may give way to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly approach. This shift is not only about reducing emissions but also about reshaping urban planning, promoting healthier lifestyles, and fostering a sense of community that transcends the limitations of car-dependent living. In embracing smart planning and limiting car usage, communities worldwide can contribute to a greener, more sustainable future.

Smog is when the cars emit there gases out of there tailpipe, and get trapped in the atmosphere causing people to have problems breathing. Articles in the city of Paris in France said that they had to ban cars due to the smog in the atmosphere. They hit a near record of air pollution and stopped people form using there cars on certain days to clear the smog from the atmosphere. On that five day period of the intensifying smog actually rivaled the place of Beijing, China which is known to be one of the most polluted cities in the world. Once the smog cleared they rescind the ban of car usage only to be a the same place there are going to be now if they keep on using cars.

In addition, cities around the world are creating new communities where they are not allowed to use cars. In Vauban, Germany the residents there are in a set up where they cannot use cars in there everyday life. 70 percent of the people over there do not own a car and 57 percent sold their car just to move into the community. "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way," said Heidrum Walter, a resident of the city. Other places in the world like in Bogota, Colombia is in a program that they cannot use cars in there life. The life were they are no cars is a good life for a community and for everyone else.

Lastly, the end of transportion is not done, but people are finding new ways of transportation. Newer ways of transportation has stared in New York they have a bikesharing program has skyrocketed. As well as car pooling since only one car or van is being used rather than 4 of 5 cars it is more efficient. People in the United states are using these ideas in there everyday life. Sutdies have shown that are less likely to get their drivers liscense and get a car. The world will be in a better place without car usage.

To summerize, limiting car usage is a extrodinary idea to make the world a better place. To cease the air pollution of smog, to make greener communities, and to make efficent ways of transportation.

EXAMPLE 2:
Cars have been around since the 1800's and have been popular ever since. Although, in recent years the number of cars bought and licenses attained have been dropping. Car usage has also dropped, which is a good thing. Because of limited car usage, people are helping the environment and benefiting themselves.

Cars emit pollution which harm our health and the environment's health.

"...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States." Cars make up a large amount of the emissions that do harm to the environment. When car usage is limited, less people drive, which in turn limits pollution. "... but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars are owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities." Again we see that cars are polluting our world, and it's caused by us. " it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants." Cars and other transportation are releasing emissions which are harming the environment. Limited car usage clears up the pollution which helps us and the environment stay healthy.

Many people are taking up new ways of transportation due to bans and such which are due to limits on car usage. They are taking public transportation, walking, carpooling, and so on. All of these methods of alternative transportation are beneficial. "They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends." It is better to limit car usage because not only are you helping the environment, but you're also saving money and helping yourself out. Due to the lower amount of people who buy cars because of limited car usage, car corporations are also changing. "He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.' " The way people live will benefit from lower car usage. Our lifes will be much safer. Although some people may be upset if they can't drive their cars when they want, in the long run it benefits all of the community.

As bans continued to be passed and people are choosing to walk or take the bus instead, limted car usage continues. We can see that it is beneficial to us and will help our environment in the long run. Limited car usage is truely a good thing for us and will hopefully continue.

In today's rapidly changing world, the idea of limiting car usage is gaining traction as communities seek innovative solutions to address environmental concerns, promote healthier lifestyles, and redefine urban planning. Examining successful experiments in places like Vauban, Germany, and Bogota, Colombia, as well as the impact of pollution-driven driving bans in Paris, it becomes evident that limiting car usage brings numerous advantages.

One of the most pressing issues associated with car usage is air pollution, particularly in densely populated urban areas. The smog levels in cities like Paris have reached alarming levels, comparable to those in notoriously polluted cities such as Beijing. The detrimental effects on public health and the environment necessitate a reevaluation of our dependence on cars. By adopting policies that limit or even eliminate car usage on specific days or in designated areas, cities can significantly reduce pollution levels and create a healthier living environment for their residents.

The success of car-free communities, exemplified by Vauban in Germany, showcases the potential benefits of reshaping urban landscapes. In Vauban, residents have willingly given up their cars, resulting in reduced stress, increased happiness, and a stronger sense of community. The emphasis on smart planning, with stores conveniently located within walking distance along main streets, offers a model for creating compact and accessible suburban developments worldwide. By challenging the traditional notion that suburbs must revolve around car-centric lifestyles, Vauban and similar initiatives pave the way for a more sustainable and interconnected future.

Additionally, events like Bogota's Car-Free Day demonstrate that alternative modes of transportation can be both practical and enjoyable. Millions of Colombians embraced the initiative, choosing to hike, bike, skate, or use public transportation, effectively reducing traffic congestion and promoting a sense of shared responsibility. The success of such programs encourages other cities to explore similar strategies, fostering a global shift towards more sustainable transportation options.

Moreover, changing demographics and evolving societal attitudes are contributing to a decline in car ownership and driving. Younger generations, influenced by factors such as the rise of telecommuting, shared mobility services, and environmental consciousness, are less inclined to obtain driver's licenses and purchase cars. This cultural shift aligns with broader goals of reducing carbon emissions and creating more environmentally friendly modes of transportation.

In conclusion, limiting car usage emerges as a transformative and forward-thinking approach to addressing environmental challenges, enhancing community well-being, and redefining urban landscapes. Drawing inspiration from successful examples worldwide, it is clear that transitioning away from car-centric lifestyles can lead to healthier, happier, and more sustainable communities. As we navigate the future, embracing innovative solutions and reconsidering our dependence on cars will be crucial in shaping a more environmentally conscious and interconnected world.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

EXAMPLE 1:
Have you ever wondered what will happen if we keep using cars as a means of transportation? All the air pollution, killing the atmosphere, wasting valuable resources. The future is going to be a place where we can't even breathe in air without having a mask on our heads due to smog. Going green as in limiting cars is a tremendous idea for the communities, and for the planet for various reasons. No smog in the atmosphere, greener communities, and more beneficial ways of transportation. Once you go green you will go never back.

In the fast-paced and ever-evolving world of today, the notion of limiting car usage might seem unconventional to many. However, as we delve into examples from around the globe, it becomes evident that restricting our reliance on cars can yield numerous advantages for both local communities and the planet at large.

One striking instance is the German suburb of Vauban, where residents have embraced a lifestyle devoid of personal vehicles. In this groundbreaking experiment, street parking and home garages are forbidden, and car ownership is permitted only with designated parking spaces located at the edge of the community. The result? A staggering 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent even sold their cars to join this car-free haven. This shift has led to a palpable improvement in residents' quality of life, with one resident noting, "When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." Vauban stands as a testament to the growing global movement of "smart planning," emphasizing reduced dependence on cars for suburban living.

Beyond the confines of Vauban, cities worldwide are rethinking their approach to transportation planning, recognizing the need to separate suburban life from excessive auto use. The traditional suburban model, centered around cars, has been identified as a significant impediment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, passenger cars are responsible for a substantial portion of emissions, ranging from 12 percent in Europe to a staggering 50 percent in certain car-intensive areas of the United States. This realization has prompted urban planners to adopt innovative strategies, mirroring the principles of Vauban, to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation.

Paris provides another compelling example of the benefits of restricting car usage. Faced with near-record pollution levels, the city implemented a partial driving ban, alternating between even and odd-numbered license plates on consecutive days. The results were dramatic, with a 60 percent reduction in congestion and a noticeable improvement in air quality. While some inconvenience was caused, the ban underscored the immediate positive impact on the environment and public health.

Moreover, initiatives like the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, demonstrate that entire cities can embrace alternative transportation. Millions of Colombians participated in a day without cars, promoting walking, biking, and the use of public transit. Such events not only reduce air pollution but also foster a sense of community engagement and well-being.

The shifting landscape of car culture is further highlighted by studies indicating a decline in car ownership, driving, and license acquisition in the United States. This trend, often predating the economic downturn, suggests a fundamental change in societal behavior. Younger generations, in particular, are less inclined to prioritize car ownership, opting for alternative means of transportation such as biking, walking, or public transit. If this pattern continues, it could have profound implications for reducing carbon emissions and mitigating environmental impact.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are multifaceted and extend beyond immediate environmental benefits. From the serene streets of Vauban to the smog-ridden skies of Paris, the global shift towards smarter planning and alternative transportation modes signals a promising future. As communities adapt and individuals embrace a car-free lifestyle, they contribute not only to a healthier planet but also to the creation of more livable and sustainable urban spaces.

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

EXAMPLE 1:
Have you ever wondered what will happen if we keep using cars as a means of transportation? All the air pollution, killing the atmosphere, wasting valuable resources. The future is going to be a place where we can't even breathe in air without having a mask on our heads due to smog. Going green as in limiting cars is a tremendous idea for the communities, and for the planet for various reasons. No smog in the atmosphere, greener communities, and more beneficial ways of transportation. Once you go green you will go never back.

To start off, Smog is one of the main disadvantages of owning or being in heavily populated area where they use cars frequently. Smog is when the cars emit there gases out of there tailpipe, and get trapped in the atmosphere causing people to have problems breathing. Articles in the city of Paris in France said that they had to ban cars due to the smog in the atmosphere. They hit a near record of air pollution and stopped people form using there cars on certain days to clear the smog from the atmosphere. On that five day period of the intensifying smog actually rivaled the place of Beijing, China which is known to be one of the most polluted cities in the world. Once the smog cleared they rescind the ban of car usage only to be a the same place there are going to be now if they keep on using cars.

In addition, cities around the world are creating new communities where they are not allowed to use cars. In Vauban, Germany the residents there are in a set up where they cannot use cars in there everyday life. 70 percent of the people over there do not own a car and 57 percent sold their car just to move into the community. "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way," said Heidrum Walter, a resident of the city. Other places in the world like in Bogota, Colombia is in a program that they cannot use cars in there life. The life were they are no cars is a good life for a community and for everyone else.

Lastly, the end of transportion is not done, but people are finding new ways of transportation. Newer ways of transportation has stared in New York they have a bikesharing program has skyrocketed. As well as car pooling since only one car or van is being used rather than 4 of 5 cars it is more efficient. People in the United states are using these ideas in there everyday life. Sutdies have shown that are less likely to get their drivers liscense and get a car. The world will be in a better place without car usage.

To summerize, limiting car usage is a extrodinary idea to make the world a better place. To cease the air pollution of smog, to make greener communities, and to make efficent ways of transportation.

EXAMPLE 2:
Cars have been around since the 1800's and have been popular ever since. Although, in recent years the number of cars bought and licenses attained have been dropping. Car usage has also dropped, which is a good thing. Because of limited car usage, people are helping the environment and benefiting themselves.

Cars emit pollution which harm our health and the environment's health.

"...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States." Cars make up a large amount of the emissions that do harm to the environment. When car usage is limited, less people drive, which in turn limits pollution. "... but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars are owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities." Again we see that cars are polluting our world, and it's caused by us. " it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants." Cars and other transportation are releasing emissions which are harming the environment. Limited car usage clears up the pollution which helps us and the environment stay healthy.

Many people are taking up new ways of transportation due to bans and such which are due to limits on car usage. They are taking public transportation, walking, carpooling, and so on. All of these methods of alternative transportation are beneficial. "They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends." It is better to limit car usage because not only are you helping the environment, but you're also saving money and helping yourself out. Due to the lower amount of people who buy cars because of limited car usage, car corporations are also changing. "He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.' " The way people live will benefit from lower car usage. Our lifes will be much safer. Although some people may be upset if they can't drive their cars when they want, in the long run it benefits all of the community.

As bans continued to be passed and people are choosing to walk or take the bus instead, limted car usage continues. We can see that it is beneficial to us and will help our environment in the long run. Limited car usage is truely a good thing for us and will hopefully continue.

In recent years, the notion of limiting car usage has gained traction across the globe, with various communities and cities implementing innovative strategies to reduce dependence on automobiles. This shift is not merely a matter of inconvenience; rather, it holds profound advantages for both communities and the planet at large.

One exemplary case is Vauban, Germany, where residents have become suburban pioneers by embracing a car-free lifestyle. In this experimental district, street parking and home garages are forbidden, except for a few designated areas. The result is a community where 70 percent of families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their cars to join this innovative living experiment. The residents of Vauban find solace in a life free from the tension of constant car use, as the swish of bicycles and the chatter of children replace the distant hum of motors.

Vauban is not an isolated experiment; it represents a growing trend in Europe, the United States, and beyond, advocating for smart planning that separates suburban life from auto use. With passenger cars responsible for a substantial portion of greenhouse gas emissions, especially in car-intensive areas, such a departure from car-centric living becomes crucial. This approach extends beyond Vauban, with cities worldwide adopting similar principles to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, thereby reducing the need for extensive parking spaces and promoting community-centric designs.

Paris, facing intense smog due to heavy car usage, took a drastic step by enforcing a partial driving ban based on license plate numbers. The results were telling, with a 60 percent reduction in congestion and a noticeable improvement in air quality. This demonstrates that limiting car usage, even temporarily, can have a tangible positive impact on the environment.

In Bogota, Colombia, a recurring "Car-free day" has become a major hit. Millions of Colombians participate by hiking, biking, skating, or opting for buses, leaving the streets eerily devoid of traffic jams. This initiative not only promotes alternative transportation but also serves as a model for other cities aiming to reduce smog and enhance the quality of urban life.

Moreover, the United States is experiencing a cultural shift in driving habits. Studies indicate a decline in car ownership and a reduction in the number of miles driven per person, challenging the long-standing car culture. Younger generations, in particular, are showing less interest in obtaining driver's licenses, opting for alternative transportation methods. This shift, if sustained, could have positive implications for carbon emissions and the environment, as transportation is a significant contributor to emissions.

In conclusion, limiting car usage emerges as an extraordinary idea with multifaceted benefits for communities and the planet. From reducing air pollution and creating greener living spaces to fostering more efficient transportation methods, the advantages are compelling. As various regions around the world experiment with and adopt car-limiting measures, it becomes evident that this paradigm shift is not only feasible but also essential for a sustainable and healthier future.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

In recent years, there has been a growing movement towards limiting car usage in various parts of the world. This shift is driven by a recognition of the detrimental impact of cars on the environment, public health, and overall quality of life. One notable example is Vauban, Germany, where residents have willingly given up their cars, leading to streets that are entirely "car-free" except for essential routes. This pioneering community, completed in 2006, serves as a model for the global trend towards what is termed "smart planning."

The primary motivation behind limiting car usage is the substantial environmental benefit. Cars are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, responsible for 12 percent in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. The detrimental effects of such emissions are evident in cities like Paris, where a driving ban was enforced to combat near-record pollution levels. The ban led to a 60 percent reduction in congestion and highlighted the immediate positive impact of reducing car usage on air quality.

Moreover, limiting car usage contributes to the creation of greener communities. In Vauban, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their cars to move there, emphasizing the shift in lifestyle and priorities. The design of such communities promotes pedestrian-friendly environments, with stores strategically located within walking distance rather than isolated in distant malls. This approach aims to break away from the car-centric development patterns that have prevailed since World War II.

The movement to limit car usage extends beyond Europe, reaching places like Bogota, Colombia, where millions of people participate in a car-free day annually. This event, now in its third year, has successfully promoted alternative transportation methods, resulting in reduced traffic congestion and lower smog levels. The success of this initiative has inspired other cities, including Cali and Valledupar, to join the cause, indicating the potential for this trend to become a global phenomenon.

The reduction in car usage is not just a response to environmental concerns; it is also indicative of a broader cultural shift. Studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and obtaining fewer licenses, challenging the traditional car culture deeply rooted in the United States. Factors such as increased telecommuting opportunities, improved public transportation, and the rise of ride-sharing services contribute to this shift in behavior.

In conclusion, limiting car usage emerges as a transformative idea with multifaceted advantages. From combating air pollution to fostering greener communities and encouraging alternative transportation methods, the movement towards reduced car dependency represents a crucial step in creating a sustainable and healthier future for both individuals and the planet. As global awareness grows, embracing smart planning and reevaluating our reliance on cars become imperative for the well-being of current and future generations.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

EXAMPLE 1:
Have you ever wondered what will happen if we keep using cars as a means of transportation? All the air pollution, killing the atmosphere, wasting valuable resources. The future is going to be a place where we can't even breathe in air without having a mask on our heads due to smog. Going green as in limiting cars is a tremendous idea for the communities, and for the planet for various reasons. No smog in the atmosphere, greener communities, and more beneficial ways of transportation. Once you go green you will go never back.

To start off, Smog is one of the main disadvantages of owning or being in heavily populated area where they use cars frequently. Smog is when the cars emit there gases out of there tailpipe, and get trapped in the atmosphere causing people to have problems breathing. Articles in the city of Paris in France said that they had to ban cars due to the smog in the atmosphere. They hit a near record of air pollution and stopped people form using there cars on certain days to clear the smog from the atmosphere. On that five day period of the intensifying smog actually rivaled the place of Beijing, China which is known to be one of the most polluted cities in the world. Once the smog cleared they rescind the ban of car usage only to be a the same place there are going to be now if they keep on using cars.

In addition, cities around the world are creating new communities where they are not allowed to use cars. In Vauban, Germany the residents there are in a set up where they cannot use cars in there everyday life. 70 percent of the people over there do not own a car and 57 percent sold their car just to move into the community. "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way," said Heidrum Walter, a resident of the city. Other places in the world like in Bogota, Colombia is in a program that they cannot use cars in there life. The life were they are no cars is a good life for a community and for everyone else.

Lastly, the end of transportion is not done, but people are finding new ways of transportation. Newer ways of transportation has stared in New York they have a bikesharing program has skyrocketed. As well as car pooling since only one car or van is being used rather than 4 of 5 cars it is more efficient. People in the United states are using these ideas in there everyday life. Sutdies have shown that are less likely to get their drivers liscense and get a car. The world will be in a better place without car usage.

To summerize, limiting car usage is a extrodinary idea to make the world a better place. To cease the air pollution of smog, to make greener communities, and to make efficent ways of transportation.

EXAMPLE 2:
Cars have been around since the 1800's and have been popular ever since. Although, in recent years the number of cars bought and licenses attained have been dropping. Car usage has also dropped, which is a good thing. Because of limited car usage, people are helping the environment and benefiting themselves.

Cars emit pollution which harm our health and the environment's health.

"...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States." Cars make up a large amount of the emissions that do harm to the environment. When car usage is limited, less people drive, which in turn limits pollution. "... but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars are owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities." Again we see that cars are polluting our world, and it's caused by us. " it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants." Cars and other transportation are releasing emissions which are harming the environment. Limited car usage clears up the pollution which helps us and the environment stay healthy.

Many people are taking up new ways of transportation due to bans and such which are due to limits on car usage. They are taking public transportation, walking, carpooling, and so on. All of these methods of alternative transportation are beneficial. "They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends." It is better to limit car usage because not only are you helping the environment, but you're also saving money and helping yourself out. Due to the lower amount of people who buy cars because of limited car usage, car corporations are also changing. "He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.' " The way people live will benefit from lower car usage. Our lifes will be much safer. Although some people may be upset if they can't drive their cars when they want, in the long run it benefits all of the community.

As bans continued to be passed and people are choosing to walk or take the bus instead, limted car usage continues. We can see that it is beneficial to us and will help our environment in the long run. Limited car usage is truely a good thing for us and will hopefully continue.

In today's fast-paced world, the ubiquitous presence of cars has become a norm. However, a paradigm shift is underway, challenging the conventional wisdom of car-centric living. The advantages of limiting car usage are profound, as evidenced by innovative experiments in urban planning and environmental policies.

One groundbreaking example comes from Vauban, Germany, an upscale community on the outskirts of Freiburg. Here, residents have embraced a car-free lifestyle, with strict restrictions on parking spaces and garages. In this experiment, 70 percent of families opted not to own cars, and 57 percent even sold their cars to become part of this visionary community. The impact on residents' well-being is evident, with one resident attesting, "When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." This novel approach to suburban life challenges the traditional reliance on automobiles and sets an example for other communities worldwide.

Beyond personal well-being, limiting car usage addresses critical environmental concerns. Cars are a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, responsible for 12 percent in Europe and up to 50 percent in certain car-intensive areas in the United States. Efforts to reduce emissions have traditionally focused on city centers, but now, the concept of "smart planning" is extending to the suburbs. Vauban, with its compact design and emphasis on public transportation, epitomizes this forward-thinking approach. David Goldberg of Transportation for America asserts, "All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change." As nations grapple with environmental challenges, redefining suburban living becomes imperative.

Moreover, the consequences of excessive car usage extend beyond environmental degradation. Paris, after grappling with near-record pollution, implemented a partial driving ban, with even- and odd-numbered license plates facing alternate restrictions. The ban resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion, demonstrating the immediate impact of limiting car usage on air quality. This approach, albeit temporary, provides a glimpse into a future where urban mobility is redefined to prioritize environmental well-being.

On a global scale, events like Bogota's annual car-free day showcase the potential for large-scale transformation. Millions of Colombians participated in hiking, biking, and using public transport during this initiative, emphasizing the shift towards alternative modes of transportation. Such events not only reduce air pollution but also encourage a healthier and more active lifestyle.

The trend of reduced car usage is not limited to experimental communities or special events; it is becoming a cultural shift. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less. This decline in car ownership and usage is attributed not only to economic factors but also to fundamental changes in behavior. The rise of telecommuting, improved public transportation, and the ubiquity of car-sharing programs contribute to a more sustainable and interconnected urban landscape.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is a multifaceted solution with far-reaching benefits. From the car-free streets of Vauban to the annual car-free day in Bogota, these examples underscore the positive impact on both individuals and the environment. As we navigate the challenges of the modern era, embracing alternatives to car-centric living emerges as a vital step towards creating healthier, more sustainable communities worldwide.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995.

They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

EXAMPLE 1:
Driving cars can be a danger to humans, but also a threat to the Earth. The usage of cars has plummeted since recent topics of smog, and safety. Using a car to get from point A to point B is getting out of hand and unnecessary. Limiting car usage can help save money, it can also help prevent smog or other pollution, and can make humans live a healthier life style. By limiting car usage, you are changing your life style for the better.

Less car usage can play a major role in the way you live your life. One big part of your life it could change is financial issues. Without a car you wouldnt have to spend thousands of dollars on an overpriced vehicle. Also you could save money from not having to buy overly priced gas, or having to fix any car issues, such as an oil leak. In the passage, Paris bans driving due to smog , the author states," Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters." Without all of your money going down the drain, you could spend your money in a more helpful way. With the money that you don't have to spend with car trouble, someone could by a gym membership, or they could go and renovate their house the way that they have always wanted. Without spending loads of money on a car, gas, and car problems, you could spend your money on more important things such as paying of loans.

Less car usage could also help the environment dramtically. Because of the usage of cars the environment has been hugely effected. Since the environment has been greatly affected, so has the people. Smog has been becoming a result of the pollution that cars cause. In the passage, Paris bans driving due to smog, they state,"Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plugin cars." Not only is pollution affecting the environment, but it is also affecting the way that we live our lives, and the way that we make our livings. Without the use of cars income will increase rather than decrease. Also the smog is creating a hazard to everyone who has to work, or go to school. Without the use of cars there will be no more smog, or hazardess environments to worry about.

Besides money, and pollution, there are other important reasons why less car usage would be ideal. A main point of less car usage would be for health. The world has grown to be lazy, and as a result obesity is becoming a huge issue. Walking to work, or to school can not only help the environment, but also help your immune system, and weight loss. Instead of walking, another great form of exercise that will help the environment is riding your bike. Using these tips there will be less obesity, and less pollution, and grrenhouse gas in the world.

Even though that driving has decreased 23% in the last 8 years, it is our duty to insure that the world will once again be a safe environment for everyone to live in. To insure a safe environment, the usage of cars must decrease. If the usage of cars does not decrease our money will. Money won't be the only problem though, obesity, and also smog will increase. To help save the Earth humans must cut back on using their cars. The results will be life changing.

EXAMPLE 2:
Cars are a very big apart of our lives, we rely on the to get us from point A to point B. But what if we had no need for cars anymore? What if all we needed was a good source of public transportation. Cities around the world are doing just that, private motor transportation has a lot of cons. Smog in big global cities is building up more and more environmental issues are becoming big problems due to the routine use of cars. Traffic jams and overcrowding of roads is also another big problem. There are many ways us as humans are trying to cut down on our use of private motor transportation that benefit us in so many ways.

When everyone in a big city such as Parris for example uses their own cars to go from place to place they put harmful gasses into the atmosphere. After a while of everyone driving in a big city like paris the gases and smog build up and polute the air. Parris is one of the cities trying to dramatically cut down the use of cars and provide easy to use and affordable public transportation. Public transportation cuts down the amount of people on the road and positively impacts the environment and the air around the city.

Traffic jams and overcrowding of road ways prevents the use of cars to achieve its full potential. For every person that uses public transportation that is on less car on the roads if everyone in a city such as Bogota, Colombia where to stop all usage of private motor vehicles the amount of traffic jams and overcrowding would decrease dramatically. People in Bogota, Colombia are doing that very such thing every year the city bans all non public transportation vehicles and requires all residents to find their own way to comute to where they need to go this has been going on for three straight years now "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution" says businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza.

We as humans are always on the move but some of the ways we get from place to place may not be beniffical to us overtime. The good thing about this is that governments in cities and countrys around the world are finding bennifical ways to comute other than driving your own vheicle. Since 2005 the amout of people on the road in the U.S has droped significantly and continues to drop every year. Public transportation and better laid out city plans are helping this drop in the usage of cars.

Cars get us from place to place but it would be nice if one day we wouldnt have to worry about the usage of cars i our world. With all of the banifits of not continuisly driving the world would be such a better place. One day this dream for many will become the way we all learn to live. Non reliant on private transportation.

In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage in various parts of the world, aiming to address environmental concerns, reduce traffic congestion, and promote healthier lifestyles. One notable example is the German suburb of Vauban, where residents have voluntarily given up their cars, leading to positive changes in their lives. Vauban serves as a model for the broader trend of "smart planning," which seeks to separate suburban life from excessive reliance on automobiles.

One key advantage of limiting car usage is the positive impact on residents' financial well-being. The cost associated with car ownership, including purchasing, fueling, and maintaining a vehicle, can be a significant financial burden. In Vauban, where car ownership is allowed but parking is restricted to designated garages, residents have reported financial relief and increased satisfaction with their lifestyle. The experiment in Vauban suggests that reducing dependence on cars can free up resources for other meaningful investments, such as improved housing or recreational activities.

Moreover, the environmental benefits of limiting car usage are substantial. The passage highlights the role of automobiles in contributing to greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in suburban areas. In Europe, cars account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and the figure can be as high as 50 percent in certain car-intensive regions of the United States. Initiatives like the "car-free" day in Bogota, Colombia, aim to reduce smog and promote alternative modes of transportation, contributing to cleaner air and a healthier environment.

Traffic congestion is another issue that can be mitigated by reducing car usage. The experience in Paris, where a partial driving ban was enforced during periods of intense smog, resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion. The success of such interventions suggests that limiting car usage not only improves air quality but also enhances overall urban mobility. Public transportation systems, as seen in Bogota's car-free day, offer a viable alternative, demonstrating that well-planned alternatives can effectively address traffic-related challenges.

In the United States, there is a growing awareness of the need to shift away from car-centric development. The Environmental Protection Agency is advocating for "car reduced" communities, and legislators are considering measures to prioritize public transport in federal transportation bills. The potential shift in American behavior, as evidenced by reduced car ownership and driving rates, aligns with global efforts to reshape urban planning and reduce the environmental impact of personal vehicles.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers a multitude of advantages, including financial savings, environmental sustainability, and improved urban mobility. As exemplified by Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, communities around the world are exploring innovative ways to separate suburban life from excessive reliance on cars, marking a shift towards smarter and more sustainable planning. Embracing these changes can lead to healthier, more cost-effective, and environmentally friendly communities.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care.

He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

In the quest for a more sustainable and healthier way of life, limiting car usage emerges as a promising solution. The case of Vauban, Germany, stands out as a pioneering example, where residents have willingly relinquished car ownership. This intentional shift away from cars is part of a broader global movement known as "smart planning," challenging the traditional association between suburbs and automobiles.

Vauban's success in reducing car dependency is reflected in striking statistics: 70 percent of families in this community do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their cars to embrace a lifestyle centered around alternative modes of transportation. As suburban areas worldwide grapple with the environmental impact of car-centric living, the need for change becomes evident. According to experts cited in the passages, cars are responsible for a substantial portion of greenhouse gas emissions, ranging from 12 percent in Europe to a staggering 50 percent in certain car-intensive regions of the United States.

Efforts to reshape suburban life are underway, aiming for a more sustainable and accessible future. Vauban's model, where car usage is minimized, is gaining traction globally. The paradigm shift involves designing suburbs to be more compact, prioritizing public transportation, and reducing space dedicated to parking. This novel approach challenges the conventional suburban blueprint, favoring walkable main streets over distant malls and encouraging a shift from individual car ownership to community-focused transport solutions.

The initiatives in Bogota, Colombia, further emphasize the potential benefits of reducing car usage. The annual "Day Without Cars" not only promotes alternative transportation but also demonstrates the feasibility of a city functioning without the overwhelming presence of private vehicles. Beyond the immediate environmental impact, such events contribute to a broader cultural shift by encouraging people to explore healthier commuting options like biking, walking, or using public transportation.

While the movement to limit car usage gains momentum globally, the United States is not immune to this shift. Recent trends suggest a decline in car ownership and miles driven per person, challenging the long-standing association between American culture and automobiles. As the country grapples with the implications of this potential "peak driving" phenomenon, experts speculate on the positive environmental implications, highlighting the reduction of carbon emissions and the potential for a healthier, less car-dependent lifestyle.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage extend beyond individual preferences to encompass broader societal and environmental benefits. From financial savings to reduced pollution and improved health outcomes, embracing alternative modes of transportation represents a crucial step toward a more sustainable and resilient future. As communities worldwide experiment with innovative approaches, the collective effort to redefine suburban life and reduce reliance on cars promises a brighter, cleaner, and healthier world for future generations.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

EXAMPLE 1:
Driving cars can be a danger to humans, but also a threat to the Earth. The usage of cars has plummeted since recent topics of smog, and safety. Using a car to get from point A to point B is getting out of hand and unnecessary. Limiting car usage can help save money, it can also help prevent smog or other pollution, and can make humans live a healthier life style. By limiting car usage, you are changing your life style for the better.

Less car usage can play a major role in the way you live your life. One big part of your life it could change is financial issues. Without a car you wouldnt have to spend thousands of dollars on an overpriced vehicle. Also you could save money from not having to buy overly priced gas, or having to fix any car issues, such as an oil leak. In the passage, Paris bans driving due to smog , the author states," Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters." Without all of your money going down the drain, you could spend your money in a more helpful way. With the money that you don't have to spend with car trouble, someone could by a gym membership, or they could go and renovate their house the way that they have always wanted. Without spending loads of money on a car, gas, and car problems, you could spend your money on more important things such as paying of loans.

Less car usage could also help the environment dramtically. Because of the usage of cars the environment has been hugely effected. Since the environment has been greatly affected, so has the people. Smog has been becoming a result of the pollution that cars cause. In the passage, Paris bans driving due to smog, they state,"Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plugin cars." Not only is pollution affecting the environment, but it is also affecting the way that we live our lives, and the way that we make our livings. Without the use of cars income will increase rather than decrease. Also the smog is creating a hazard to everyone who has to work, or go to school. Without the use of cars there will be no more smog, or hazardess environments to worry about.

Besides money, and pollution, there are other important reasons why less car usage would be ideal. A main point of less car usage would be for health. The world has grown to be lazy, and as a result obesity is becoming a huge issue. Walking to work, or to school can not only help the environment, but also help your immune system, and weight loss. Instead of walking, another great form of exercise that will help the environment is riding your bike. Using these tips there will be less obesity, and less pollution, and grrenhouse gas in the world.

Even though that driving has decreased 23% in the last 8 years, it is our duty to insure that the world will once again be a safe environment for everyone to live in. To insure a safe environment, the usage of cars must decrease. If the usage of cars does not decrease our money will. Money won't be the only problem though, obesity, and also smog will increase. To help save the Earth humans must cut back on using their cars. The results will be life changing.

EXAMPLE 2:
Cars are a very big apart of our lives, we rely on the to get us from point A to point B. But what if we had no need for cars anymore? What if all we needed was a good source of public transportation. Cities around the world are doing just that, private motor transportation has a lot of cons. Smog in big global cities is building up more and more environmental issues are becoming big problems due to the routine use of cars. Traffic jams and overcrowding of roads is also another big problem. There are many ways us as humans are trying to cut down on our use of private motor transportation that benefit us in so many ways.

When everyone in a big city such as Parris for example uses their own cars to go from place to place they put harmful gasses into the atmosphere. After a while of everyone driving in a big city like paris the gases and smog build up and polute the air. Parris is one of the cities trying to dramatically cut down the use of cars and provide easy to use and affordable public transportation. Public transportation cuts down the amount of people on the road and positively impacts the environment and the air around the city.

Traffic jams and overcrowding of road ways prevents the use of cars to achieve its full potential. For every person that uses public transportation that is on less car on the roads if everyone in a city such as Bogota, Colombia where to stop all usage of private motor vehicles the amount of traffic jams and overcrowding would decrease dramatically. People in Bogota, Colombia are doing that very such thing every year the city bans all non public transportation vehicles and requires all residents to find their own way to comute to where they need to go this has been going on for three straight years now "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution" says businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza.

We as humans are always on the move but some of the ways we get from place to place may not be beniffical to us overtime. The good thing about this is that governments in cities and countrys around the world are finding bennifical ways to comute other than driving your own vheicle. Since 2005 the amout of people on the road in the U.S has droped significantly and continues to drop every year. Public transportation and better laid out city plans are helping this drop in the usage of cars.

Cars get us from place to place but it would be nice if one day we wouldnt have to worry about the usage of cars i our world. With all of the banifits of not continuisly driving the world would be such a better place. One day this dream for many will become the way we all learn to live. Non reliant on private transportation.

Living in a world with limited car usage may seem like an unconventional idea, but it carries numerous advantages that extend beyond personal convenience. As evident in various global examples, such as the German suburb Vauban, the smog-induced driving ban in Paris, and the car-free day in Bogota, limiting car usage can lead to positive changes in financial, environmental, and health aspects.

One of the most apparent benefits of reduced car usage is financial relief. The high costs associated with car ownership, including purchasing a vehicle, maintenance, and fuel expenses, can be a significant burden on individuals and families. In Vauban, Germany, residents have embraced a lifestyle without personal cars, and as a result, they report decreased stress and increased happiness. By minimizing reliance on cars, individuals can redirect their financial resources towards more meaningful pursuits, such as investments in personal well-being, education, or home improvements.

Moreover, the environmental impact of widespread car usage cannot be ignored. Cars are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, with passenger cars alone responsible for up to 50% of emissions in some car-intensive areas in the United States. The smog-induced driving ban in Paris illustrates the severe consequences of unchecked vehicular pollution. By limiting car usage and promoting alternative transportation methods, we can mitigate air pollution, reduce smog-related health hazards, and create a cleaner, more sustainable environment.

In addition to financial and environmental benefits, limiting car usage can lead to improvements in public health. The adoption of alternative transportation modes, such as walking, cycling, or using public transit, promotes physical activity and reduces sedentary behavior. As highlighted in the example of Bogota's car-free day, citizens enthusiastically embraced alternative modes of transportation, contributing to a healthier and more active lifestyle. This shift aligns with the broader trend observed in the United States, where studies suggest a decline in car ownership and driving, potentially indicating a cultural shift toward more sustainable and health-conscious choices.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage extend far beyond individual preferences. As demonstrated by various global examples, including Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, embracing alternative transportation methods can lead to financial savings, environmental sustainability, and improved public health. The current momentum toward reduced car ownership and increased focus on smart planning in urban development suggests that such a shift is not only feasible but also necessary for creating a more resilient and harmonious society.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

To help save the Earth humans must cut back on using their cars. The results will be life changing.

EXAMPLE 2:
Cars are a very big apart of our lives, we rely on the to get us from point A to point B. But what if we had no need for cars anymore? What if all we needed was a good source of public transportation. Cities around the world are doing just that, private motor transportation has a lot of cons. Smog in big global cities is building up more and more environmental issues are becoming big problems due to the routine use of cars. Traffic jams and overcrowding of roads is also another big problem. There are many ways us as humans are trying to cut down on our use of private motor transportation that benefit us in so many ways.

When everyone in a big city such as Parris for example uses their own cars to go from place to place they put harmful gasses into the atmosphere. After a while of everyone driving in a big city like paris the gases and smog build up and polute the air. Parris is one of the cities trying to dramatically cut down the use of cars and provide easy to use and affordable public transportation. Public transportation cuts down the amount of people on the road and positively impacts the environment and the air around the city.

Traffic jams and overcrowding of road ways prevents the use of cars to achieve its full potential. For every person that uses public transportation that is on less car on the roads if everyone in a city such as Bogota, Colombia where to stop all usage of private motor vehicles the amount of traffic jams and overcrowding would decrease dramatically. People in Bogota, Colombia are doing that very such thing every year the city bans all non public transportation vehicles and requires all residents to find their own way to comute to where they need to go this has been going on for three straight years now "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution" says businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza.

We as humans are always on the move but some of the ways we get from place to place may not be beniffical to us overtime. The good thing about this is that governments in cities and countrys around the world are finding bennifical ways to comute other than driving your own vheicle. Since 2005 the amout of people on the road in the U.S has droped significantly and continues to drop every year. Public transportation and better laid out city plans are helping this drop in the usage of cars.

Cars get us from place to place but it would be nice if one day we wouldnt have to worry about the usage of cars i our world. With all of the banifits of not continuisly driving the world would be such a better place. One day this dream for many will become the way we all learn to live. Non reliant on private transportation.

In recent years, a compelling movement has emerged across the globe, challenging the conventional reliance on private cars and advocating for a more sustainable, eco-friendly lifestyle. From the car-free streets of Vauban, Germany, to the temporary bans on driving in Paris due to smog, and the annual car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, various communities are pioneering the transition away from car-centric living. This paradigm shift, often referred to as "smart planning," not only presents a unique model for suburban development but also brings forth several advantages that can positively impact our lives and the environment.

One significant advantage of limiting car usage lies in the financial realm. The cost associated with car ownership, including purchasing, maintaining, and fueling, is a substantial financial burden for many. In Vauban, residents have embraced a car-free lifestyle, redirecting their resources towards more meaningful pursuits. As the passage on Paris' driving ban highlights, fines for violating restrictions on driving were imposed, underscoring the economic consequences of excessive car use. By reducing reliance on personal vehicles, individuals can potentially save significant amounts of money, redirecting those funds toward other essential needs or more enriching experiences.

Environmental considerations form another crucial aspect of limiting car usage. The passages provide evidence of the detrimental impact of cars on air quality, with smog becoming a pressing issue in cities like Paris. The emissions from automobiles contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, a major concern for the global environment. In the broader context, the reduction of car usage aligns with efforts to combat climate change. Creating car-free zones and promoting alternative modes of transportation, as seen in Bogota's car-free day, can lead to improved air quality and a healthier environment.

Beyond financial and environmental benefits, the movement towards limiting car usage has positive implications for public health. The sedentary lifestyle associated with car dependence contributes to rising obesity rates. Encouraging alternative modes of transportation, such as walking or biking, not only reduces the environmental impact but also promotes physical activity, leading to healthier communities. As highlighted in the passage on Bogota, where millions participated in a car-free day, these initiatives can have a profound impact on stress reduction and overall well-being.

In the United States, there is a notable trend indicating a shift in behavior, with Americans buying fewer cars and driving less. This shift, if sustained, could have far-reaching implications for carbon emissions and the environment. As the passage on "The End of Car Culture" suggests, technological advancements, demographic shifts, and changes in societal preferences are contributing to this transformation. The emergence of shared transportation services and bike-sharing programs, coupled with a decline in the percentage of young people obtaining driver's licenses, signals a cultural shift away from traditional car ownership.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is not just an abstract concept; it is a tangible and beneficial shift that communities around the world are actively embracing. From financial savings and environmental conservation to improvements in public health, the advantages of reducing dependence on private cars are multifaceted. As we navigate the challenges of the 21st century, rethinking our reliance on cars emerges as a crucial step towards creating sustainable, healthier, and more vibrant communities.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

EXAMPLE 1:
Driving cars can be a danger to humans, but also a threat to the Earth. The usage of cars has plummeted since recent topics of smog, and safety. Using a car to get from point A to point B is getting out of hand and unnecessary. Limiting car usage can help save money, it can also help prevent smog or other pollution, and can make humans live a healthier life style. By limiting car usage, you are changing your life style for the better.

Less car usage can play a major role in the way you live your life. One big part of your life it could change is financial issues. Without a car you wouldnt have to spend thousands of dollars on an overpriced vehicle. Also you could save money from not having to buy overly priced gas, or having to fix any car issues, such as an oil leak. In the passage, Paris bans driving due to smog , the author states," Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters." Without all of your money going down the drain, you could spend your money in a more helpful way. With the money that you don't have to spend with car trouble, someone could by a gym membership, or they could go and renovate their house the way that they have always wanted. Without spending loads of money on a car, gas, and car problems, you could spend your money on more important things such as paying of loans.

Less car usage could also help the environment dramtically. Because of the usage of cars the environment has been hugely effected. Since the environment has been greatly affected, so has the people. Smog has been becoming a result of the pollution that cars cause. In the passage, Paris bans driving due to smog, they state,"Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plugin cars." Not only is pollution affecting the environment, but it is also affecting the way that we live our lives, and the way that we make our livings. Without the use of cars income will increase rather than decrease. Also the smog is creating a hazard to everyone who has to work, or go to school. Without the use of cars there will be no more smog, or hazardess environments to worry about.

Besides money, and pollution, there are other important reasons why less car usage would be ideal. A main point of less car usage would be for health. The world has grown to be lazy, and as a result obesity is becoming a huge issue. Walking to work, or to school can not only help the environment, but also help your immune system, and weight loss. Instead of walking, another great form of exercise that will help the environment is riding your bike. Using these tips there will be less obesity, and less pollution, and grrenhouse gas in the world.

Even though that driving has decreased 23% in the last 8 years, it is our duty to insure that the world will once again be a safe environment for everyone to live in. To insure a safe environment, the usage of cars must decrease. If the usage of cars does not decrease our money will. Money won't be the only problem though, obesity, and also smog will increase. To help save the Earth humans must cut back on using their cars. The results will be life changing.

In recent years, the idea of limiting car usage has gained traction around the world, driven by various factors such as environmental concerns, health benefits, and urban planning initiatives. The experiences of communities like Vauban in Germany, the response to smog-induced driving bans in Paris, and the success of car-free days in Bogota all contribute to a growing awareness of the advantages of reducing our reliance on private vehicles.

One compelling argument in favor of limiting car usage is the potential financial relief it can bring to individuals and communities. The cost associated with car ownership, as highlighted in the case of Vauban, includes not just the purchase of the vehicle but also expenses related to fuel, maintenance, and parking. By embracing alternative modes of transportation or adopting car-free zones, individuals can redirect their funds towards more meaningful endeavors, such as health and fitness activities or home improvements.

Furthermore, the environmental impact of widespread car usage is a matter of increasing concern. The emissions from passenger cars contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, as noted in the passage, with automobiles responsible for up to 50 percent of emissions in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Initiatives like the car-free day in Bogota and the driving bans in Paris demonstrate a commitment to mitigating the environmental impact of private transportation. Less reliance on cars not only reduces air pollution but also helps combat climate change, making it a crucial step towards a more sustainable future.

Another noteworthy advantage of limiting car usage is the potential for improved public health. As mentioned in the essay about the end of car culture, the decrease in driving is associated with positive health outcomes. Encouraging walking, biking, or the use of public transportation promotes physical activity, reduces sedentary behavior, and addresses the growing issue of obesity. Additionally, it contributes to safer and more pedestrian-friendly urban environments, fostering community well-being.

In conclusion, the evidence from various sources supports the idea that limiting car usage can bring about numerous benefits, ranging from financial savings and environmental sustainability to improved public health. As communities worldwide grapple with the challenges posed by car-centric lifestyles, the examples set by Vauban, Paris, and Bogota showcase alternative models that prioritize smarter urban planning and reduced reliance on private vehicles. By embracing these changes, individuals and societies can pave the way for a healthier, more sustainable future.

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

EXAMPLE 1:
Driving cars can be a danger to humans, but also a threat to the Earth. The usage of cars has plummeted since recent topics of smog, and safety. Using a car to get from point A to point B is getting out of hand and unnecessary. Limiting car usage can help save money, it can also help prevent smog or other pollution, and can make humans live a healthier life style. By limiting car usage, you are changing your life style for the better.

Less car usage can play a major role in the way you live your life. One big part of your life it could change is financial issues. Without a car you wouldnt have to spend thousands of dollars on an overpriced vehicle. Also you could save money from not having to buy overly priced gas, or having to fix any car issues, such as an oil leak. In the passage, Paris bans driving due to smog , the author states," Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters." Without all of your money going down the drain, you could spend your money in a more helpful way. With the money that you don't have to spend with car trouble, someone could by a gym membership, or they could go and renovate their house the way that they have always wanted. Without spending loads of money on a car, gas, and car problems, you could spend your money on more important things such as paying of loans.

Less car usage could also help the environment dramtically. Because of the usage of cars the environment has been hugely effected. Since the environment has been greatly affected, so has the people. Smog has been becoming a result of the pollution that cars cause. In the passage, Paris bans driving due to smog, they state,"Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plugin cars." Not only is pollution affecting the environment, but it is also affecting the way that we live our lives, and the way that we make our livings. Without the use of cars income will increase rather than decrease. Also the smog is creating a hazard to everyone who has to work, or go to school. Without the use of cars there will be no more smog, or hazardess environments to worry about.

Besides money, and pollution, there are other important reasons why less car usage would be ideal. A main point of less car usage would be for health. The world has grown to be lazy, and as a result obesity is becoming a huge issue. Walking to work, or to school can not only help the environment, but also help your immune system, and weight loss. Instead of walking, another great form of exercise that will help the environment is riding your bike. Using these tips there will be less obesity, and less pollution, and grrenhouse gas in the world.

Even though that driving has decreased 23% in the last 8 years, it is our duty to insure that the world will once again be a safe environment for everyone to live in. To insure a safe environment, the usage of cars must decrease. If the usage of cars does not decrease our money will. Money won't be the only problem though, obesity, and also smog will increase. To help save the Earth humans must cut back on using their cars. The results will be life changing.

EXAMPLE 2:
Cars are a very big apart of our lives, we rely on the to get us from point A to point B. But what if we had no need for cars anymore? What if all we needed was a good source of public transportation. Cities around the world are doing just that, private motor transportation has a lot of cons. Smog in big global cities is building up more and more environmental issues are becoming big problems due to the routine use of cars. Traffic jams and overcrowding of roads is also another big problem. There are many ways us as humans are trying to cut down on our use of private motor transportation that benefit us in so many ways.

When everyone in a big city such as Parris for example uses their own cars to go from place to place they put harmful gasses into the atmosphere. After a while of everyone driving in a big city like paris the gases and smog build up and polute the air. Parris is one of the cities trying to dramatically cut down the use of cars and provide easy to use and affordable public transportation. Public transportation cuts down the amount of people on the road and positively impacts the environment and the air around the city.

Traffic jams and overcrowding of road ways prevents the use of cars to achieve its full potential. For every person that uses public transportation that is on less car on the roads if everyone in a city such as Bogota, Colombia where to stop all usage of private motor vehicles the amount of traffic jams and overcrowding would decrease dramatically. People in Bogota, Colombia are doing that very such thing every year the city bans all non public transportation vehicles and requires all residents to find their own way to comute to where they need to go this has been going on for three straight years now "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution" says businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza.

We as humans are always on the move but some of the ways we get from place to place may not be beniffical to us overtime. The good thing about this is that governments in cities and countrys around the world are finding bennifical ways to comute other than driving your own vheicle. Since 2005 the amout of people on the road in the U.S has droped significantly and continues to drop every year. Public transportation and better laid out city plans are helping this drop in the usage of cars.

Cars get us from place to place but it would be nice if one day we wouldnt have to worry about the usage of cars i our world. With all of the banifits of not continuisly driving the world would be such a better place. One day this dream for many will become the way we all learn to live. Non reliant on private transportation.

In recent years, there has been a growing movement around the world to limit car usage, with examples from Europe, the United States, and Colombia illustrating the benefits of such an approach. One of the pioneering communities leading this change is Vauban, Germany, where residents have embraced a car-free lifestyle. In this upscale district, street parking and private garages are prohibited, and car ownership is limited to a few designated areas. As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their cars to move there. This experiment showcases the potential advantages of reducing car dependency.

Cars, traditionally considered a symbol of suburban living, have become a significant obstacle to environmental sustainability. Passenger cars contribute up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in some car-intensive areas in the United States. To address this, urban planners are rethinking suburban development, aiming for greater compactness and accessibility to public transportation. Vauban's success serves as a model for creating low-car suburban environments where stores are within walking distance, promoting a healthier and more eco-friendly lifestyle.

The negative consequences of excessive car usage are not limited to environmental concerns; they extend to issues like smog and traffic congestion, as seen in Paris. In response to near-record pollution, Paris implemented a partial driving ban, reducing congestion by 60 percent. This restriction not only improved air quality but also encouraged the use of alternative transportation modes. Furthermore, car-free initiatives, such as the annual Day Without Cars in Bogota, Colombia, demonstrate that millions of people can successfully rely on alternative transportation methods, fostering a sense of community and significantly reducing traffic-related stress.

In the United States, President Obama's efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions coincide with a shift in American behavior. Studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. This shift, if sustained, could lead to positive implications for the environment, as transportation is a major source of emissions. Additionally, it may prompt a reevaluation of personal vehicle ownership, with companies like Ford rebranding themselves as "mobility" companies.

Limiting car usage goes beyond environmental benefits; it also has economic advantages. Individuals can save money by avoiding the high costs associated with car ownership, such as vehicle purchase, maintenance, and fuel expenses. The funds saved can be redirected toward more meaningful investments, such as health and well-being, contributing to a higher quality of life.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage extend beyond environmental concerns, impacting areas such as public health, community well-being, and personal finance. From the car-free streets of Vauban to the smog-free days in Bogota and the evolving cultural shift in the United States, the global movement towards reducing reliance on cars demonstrates a promising path toward a more sustainable and interconnected future.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

EXAMPLE 1:
Driving cars can be a danger to humans, but also a threat to the Earth. The usage of cars has plummeted since recent topics of smog, and safety. Using a car to get from point A to point B is getting out of hand and unnecessary. Limiting car usage can help save money, it can also help prevent smog or other pollution, and can make humans live a healthier life style. By limiting car usage, you are changing your life style for the better.

Less car usage can play a major role in the way you live your life. One big part of your life it could change is financial issues. Without a car you wouldnt have to spend thousands of dollars on an overpriced vehicle.

Not only is pollution affecting the environment, but it is also affecting the way that we live our lives, and the way that we make our livings. Without the use of cars income will increase rather than decrease. Also the smog is creating a hazard to everyone who has to work, or go to school. Without the use of cars there will be no more smog, or hazardess environments to worry about.

Even though that driving has decreased 23% in the last 8 years, it is our duty to insure that the world will once again be a safe environment for everyone to live in. To insure a safe environment, the usage of cars must decrease. If the usage of cars does not decrease our money will. Money won't be the only problem though, obesity, and also smog will increase. To help save the Earth humans must cut back on using their cars. The results will be life changing.

Living without cars presents numerous advantages for individuals and the environment, as demonstrated by examples from various parts of the world. One prominent illustration comes from Vauban, Germany, an experimental community that prohibits street parking, driveways, and home garages, creating a car-free environment for 70 percent of its families. The residents, embracing a lifestyle less dependent on cars, reported increased happiness and reduced stress, as revealed by Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two in Vauban. This innovative approach to suburban planning aligns with the broader global movement known as "smart planning," aiming to separate suburban life from excessive auto use.

The environmental impact of limiting car usage is especially crucial, given that passenger cars contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. Suburbs traditionally revolve around car use, but planners are now challenging this paradigm, advocating for more compact communities with better accessibility to public transportation. Vauban's success in implementing low-car suburban living exemplifies this shift. Moreover, cities like Paris have implemented driving bans during periods of intense smog, showcasing the immediate positive effects on air quality and congestion reduction. These actions underscore the pressing need to reconsider our dependence on cars to combat climate change and improve air quality.

Financial benefits also emerge when limiting car usage. The cost of car ownership, including vehicle purchase, maintenance, and fuel, can be a substantial financial burden. The example of fines imposed in Paris for violating driving bans due to smog emphasizes the potential economic consequences of excessive car use. Redirecting funds from car-related expenses to more meaningful investments, such as education, health, or leisure, becomes possible when car dependency is reduced.

Moreover, public health stands to gain from decreased car usage. Sedentary lifestyles associated with extensive car use contribute to rising obesity rates. Encouraging alternatives like walking and biking, as seen in Bogota's car-free day, not only reduces pollution but also promotes healthier living. These changes align with a broader cultural shift away from car ownership, as observed in the decline in the number of miles driven per person in the United States since 2005. Younger generations, in particular, are showing a decreased interest in car ownership, preferring alternative modes of transportation and emphasizing the importance of environmental sustainability.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers multifaceted advantages, ranging from environmental sustainability and improved air quality to financial savings and enhanced public health. The examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota provide valuable insights into the transformative potential of adopting a more mindful and sustainable approach to transportation. As societies grapple with the challenges of climate change and urban planning, reevaluating our reliance on cars emerges as a crucial step towards a more sustainable and livable future.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

EXAMPLE 1:
Driving cars can be a danger to humans, but also a threat to the Earth. The usage of cars has plummeted since recent topics of smog, and safety. Using a car to get from point A to point B is getting out of hand and unnecessary. Limiting car usage can help save money, it can also help prevent smog or other pollution, and can make humans live a healthier life style. By limiting car usage, you are changing your life style for the better.

Less car usage can play a major role in the way you live your life. One big part of your life it could change is financial issues. Without a car you wouldnt have to spend thousands of dollars on an overpriced vehicle. Also you could save money from not having to buy overly priced gas, or having to fix any car issues, such as an oil leak. In the passage, Paris bans driving due to smog , the author states," Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters." Without all of your money going down the drain, you could spend your money in a more helpful way. With the money that you don't have to spend with car trouble, someone could by a gym membership, or they could go and renovate their house the way that they have always wanted. Without spending loads of money on a car, gas, and car problems, you could spend your money on more important things such as paying of loans.

Less car usage could also help the environment dramtically. Because of the usage of cars the environment has been hugely effected. Since the environment has been greatly affected, so has the people. Smog has been becoming a result of the pollution that cars cause. In the passage, Paris bans driving due to smog, they state,"Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plugin cars." Not only is pollution affecting the environment, but it is also affecting the way that we live our lives, and the way that we make our livings. Without the use of cars income will increase rather than decrease. Also the smog is creating a hazard to everyone who has to work, or go to school. Without the use of cars there will be no more smog, or hazardess environments to worry about.

Besides money, and pollution, there are other important reasons why less car usage would be ideal. A main point of less car usage would be for health. The world has grown to be lazy, and as a result obesity is becoming a huge issue. Walking to work, or to school can not only help the environment, but also help your immune system, and weight loss. Instead of walking, another great form of exercise that will help the environment is riding your bike. Using these tips there will be less obesity, and less pollution, and grrenhouse gas in the world.

Even though that driving has decreased 23% in the last 8 years, it is our duty to insure that the world will once again be a safe environment for everyone to live in. To insure a safe environment, the usage of cars must decrease. If the usage of cars does not decrease our money will. Money won't be the only problem though, obesity, and also smog will increase. To help save the Earth humans must cut back on using their cars. The results will be life changing.

EXAMPLE 2:
Cars are a very big apart of our lives, we rely on the to get us from point A to point B. But what if we had no need for cars anymore? What if all we needed was a good source of public transportation. Cities around the world are doing just that, private motor transportation has a lot of cons. Smog in big global cities is building up more and more environmental issues are becoming big problems due to the routine use of cars. Traffic jams and overcrowding of roads is also another big problem. There are many ways us as humans are trying to cut down on our use of private motor transportation that benefit us in so many ways.

When everyone in a big city such as Parris for example uses their own cars to go from place to place they put harmful gasses into the atmosphere. After a while of everyone driving in a big city like paris the gases and smog build up and polute the air. Parris is one of the cities trying to dramatically cut down the use of cars and provide easy to use and affordable public transportation. Public transportation cuts down the amount of people on the road and positively impacts the environment and the air around the city.

Traffic jams and overcrowding of road ways prevents the use of cars to achieve its full potential. For every person that uses public transportation that is on less car on the roads if everyone in a city such as Bogota, Colombia where to stop all usage of private motor vehicles the amount of traffic jams and overcrowding would decrease dramatically. People in Bogota, Colombia are doing that very such thing every year the city bans all non public transportation vehicles and requires all residents to find their own way to comute to where they need to go this has been going on for three straight years now "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution" says businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza.

We as humans are always on the move but some of the ways we get from place to place may not be beniffical to us overtime. The good thing about this is that governments in cities and countrys around the world are finding bennifical ways to comute other than driving your own vheicle. Since 2005 the amout of people on the road in the U.S has droped significantly and continues to drop every year. Public transportation and better laid out city plans are helping this drop in the usage of cars.

Cars get us from place to place but it would be nice if one day we wouldnt have to worry about the usage of cars i our world. With all of the banifits of not continuisly driving the world would be such a better place. One day this dream for many will become the way we all learn to live. Non reliant on private transportation.

In recent years, a growing number of communities worldwide are embracing a transformative shift in urban planning, distancing themselves from heavy reliance on private car usage. This shift is not merely an experiment but a tangible effort to create more sustainable, healthier, and environmentally conscious living spaces. The advantages of limiting car usage, as observed in various examples from Germany to Colombia and even the United States, extend beyond individual preferences to encompass financial savings, environmental benefits, and improvements in public health.

Financial considerations are a significant incentive for individuals and families to limit car ownership. In the German suburb of Vauban, where streets are "car-free" and parking is restricted, families have chosen a lifestyle that minimizes the financial burden associated with car ownership. With only two designated parking areas on the outskirts, car owners incur substantial costs, such as a $40,000 fee for a parking space. As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families opt not to own cars, freeing up substantial funds that can be redirected toward other essential needs or personal enrichment.

Beyond the financial realm, the environmental impact of reducing car usage is a compelling reason for communities to adopt such measures. Greenhouse gas emissions from passenger cars contribute significantly to air pollution and climate change. In Paris, faced with near-record pollution levels, authorities enforced a partial driving ban, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion. This drastic measure not only cleared the air but also highlighted the detrimental effects of excessive car usage, particularly when fueled by diesel. Similar initiatives, like the car-free day in Bogota, showcase the potential for reduced emissions and improved air quality when private cars are temporarily eliminated from city streets.

Moreover, the public health benefits of limiting car usage cannot be understated. Encouraging alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, or the use of public transit, promotes physical activity and reduces sedentary lifestyles. In cities like Bogota, where a car-free day has become an annual event, millions of residents embrace alternative means of transportation, contributing to lower stress levels and improved air quality. These changes not only benefit individuals but also foster a sense of community engagement, as witnessed by the enthusiastic participation of millions in the event.

As the trend toward limiting car usage gains momentum, it aligns with broader societal shifts. Studies suggest a decline in car ownership and driving in the United States, signaling a potential cultural shift away from the traditional attachment to personal vehicles. Initiatives promoting alternative transportation, such as bike-sharing programs and carpooling apps, are gaining traction. The evolution of urban landscapes to prioritize pedestrians and cyclists over private cars reflects an acknowledgment that the era of car-centric development must evolve to meet the challenges of the present and future.

In conclusion, limiting car usage represents a multifaceted approach to addressing financial, environmental, and public health concerns. Communities worldwide are reimagining urban living by embracing "smart planning," where car-free zones, robust public transportation, and alternative modes of commuting are prioritized. These initiatives signal a departure from the status quo, promoting a more sustainable, interconnected, and healthier way of life for citizens. As we navigate the changing landscape of urban development, the advantages of limiting car usage are not only evident but crucial for building a more resilient and vibrant future.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

EXAMPLE 1:
Driving cars can be a danger to humans, but also a threat to the Earth. The usage of cars has plummeted since recent topics of smog, and safety. Using a car to get from point A to point B is getting out of hand and unnecessary. Limiting car usage can help save money, it can also help prevent smog or other pollution, and can make humans live a healthier life style. By limiting car usage, you are changing your life style for the better.

Less car usage can play a major role in the way you live your life. One big part of your life it could change is financial issues. Without a car you wouldnt have to spend thousands of dollars on an overpriced vehicle. Also you could save money from not having to buy overly priced gas, or having to fix any car issues, such as an oil leak. In the passage, Paris bans driving due to smog , the author states," Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters." Without all of your money going down the drain, you could spend your money in a more helpful way. With the money that you don't have to spend with car trouble, someone could by a gym membership, or they could go and renovate their house the way that they have always wanted. Without spending loads of money on a car, gas, and car problems, you could spend your money on more important things such as paying of loans.

Less car usage could also help the environment dramtically. Because of the usage of cars the environment has been hugely effected. Since the environment has been greatly affected, so has the people. Smog has been becoming a result of the pollution that cars cause. In the passage, Paris bans driving due to smog, they state,"Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plugin cars." Not only is pollution affecting the environment, but it is also affecting the way that we live our lives, and the way that we make our livings. Without the use of cars income will increase rather than decrease. Also the smog is creating a hazard to everyone who has to work, or go to school. Without the use of cars there will be no more smog, or hazardess environments to worry about.

Besides money, and pollution, there are other important reasons why less car usage would be ideal. A main point of less car usage would be for health. The world has grown to be lazy, and as a result obesity is becoming a huge issue. Walking to work, or to school can not only help the environment, but also help your immune system, and weight loss. Instead of walking, another great form of exercise that will help the environment is riding your bike. Using these tips there will be less obesity, and less pollution, and grrenhouse gas in the world.

Even though that driving has decreased 23% in the last 8 years, it is our duty to insure that the world will once again be a safe environment for everyone to live in. To insure a safe environment, the usage of cars must decrease. If the usage of cars does not decrease our money will. Money won't be the only problem though, obesity, and also smog will increase. To help save the Earth humans must cut back on using their cars. The results will be life changing.

EXAMPLE 2:
Cars are a very big apart of our lives, we rely on the to get us from point A to point B. But what if we had no need for cars anymore? What if all we needed was a good source of public transportation. Cities around the world are doing just that, private motor transportation has a lot of cons. Smog in big global cities is building up more and more environmental issues are becoming big problems due to the routine use of cars. Traffic jams and overcrowding of roads is also another big problem. There are many ways us as humans are trying to cut down on our use of private motor transportation that benefit us in so many ways.

When everyone in a big city such as Parris for example uses their own cars to go from place to place they put harmful gasses into the atmosphere. After a while of everyone driving in a big city like paris the gases and smog build up and polute the air. Parris is one of the cities trying to dramatically cut down the use of cars and provide easy to use and affordable public transportation. Public transportation cuts down the amount of people on the road and positively impacts the environment and the air around the city.

Traffic jams and overcrowding of road ways prevents the use of cars to achieve its full potential. For every person that uses public transportation that is on less car on the roads if everyone in a city such as Bogota, Colombia where to stop all usage of private motor vehicles the amount of traffic jams and overcrowding would decrease dramatically. People in Bogota, Colombia are doing that very such thing every year the city bans all non public transportation vehicles and requires all residents to find their own way to comute to where they need to go this has been going on for three straight years now "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution" says businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza.

We as humans are always on the move but some of the ways we get from place to place may not be beniffical to us overtime. The good thing about this is that governments in cities and countrys around the world are finding bennifical ways to comute other than driving your own vheicle. Since 2005 the amout of people on the road in the U.S has droped significantly and continues to drop every year. Public transportation and better laid out city plans are helping this drop in the usage of cars.

Cars get us from place to place but it would be nice if one day we wouldnt have to worry about the usage of cars i our world. With all of the banifits of not continuisly driving the world would be such a better place. One day this dream for many will become the way we all learn to live. Non reliant on private transportation.

Living in a world with limited car usage can bring about numerous advantages, influencing our finances, the environment, and even our overall well-being. As we observe initiatives in various parts of the globe, such as Vauban in Germany, Paris in France, and Bogota in Colombia, a compelling case emerges for a shift towards smarter and more sustainable living.

Financially, reducing reliance on personal vehicles can lead to significant savings. Consider the exorbitant costs associated with car ownership—vehicle purchase, maintenance, insurance, and fuel expenses. In Vauban, residents have embraced a lifestyle where car ownership is not the norm, with only 30 percent of families owning cars. The financial benefits are evident, freeing up funds that can be redirected towards health, education, or leisure activities. Paris's enforcement of a partial driving ban during days of intense pollution further underscores the financial implications of excessive car usage, with fines imposed on thousands of drivers.

Beyond personal finances, limiting car usage has far-reaching environmental benefits. The environmental toll of cars, as significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, is a pressing concern. In Europe alone, passenger cars account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, rising to 50 percent in certain car-intensive areas in the United States. Smog, a direct consequence of vehicular emissions, has led cities like Paris to implement temporary driving bans to mitigate pollution levels. By curbing car usage, we not only contribute to cleaner air but also alleviate the strain on our ecosystems.

Moreover, embracing alternatives to car-centric lifestyles can promote healthier living. In Bogota, the annual "Day Without Cars" encourages millions of Colombians to choose alternative modes of transportation, such as hiking, biking, skating, or using public buses. This event not only reduces traffic congestion but also fosters physical activity, addressing concerns related to sedentary lifestyles and obesity. The decline in driving observed in the United States, as reflected in President Obama's greenhouse gas reduction goals, hints at a cultural shift—one where people prioritize alternative, healthier modes of commuting.

In conclusion, limiting car usage emerges as a multifaceted solution to address financial, environmental, and health-related challenges. Initiatives from cities around the world demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of transitioning towards a smarter, more sustainable way of life. As we contemplate the impact of our choices on the planet and future generations, embracing such changes becomes not just a necessity but a pathway to a more balanced and harmonious existence.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care.

In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage, and examples from around the world demonstrate the advantages of such an approach. One noteworthy case is the German suburb of Vauban, where residents have embraced a car-free lifestyle. In Vauban, the design of the community discourages traditional car ownership by restricting parking options and promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as walking and cycling. This intentional separation of suburban life from heavy reliance on cars is part of a broader global trend known as "smart planning."

Vauban serves as a pioneering experiment in low-car suburban living, challenging the conventional notion that automobiles are indispensable to suburban lifestyles. The success of Vauban's model is evident in the fact that 70 percent of families in the community do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their cars to move there. Residents, like media trainer Heidrun Walter, attest to the positive impact of this lifestyle shift, noting increased happiness and reduced stress compared to when they owned cars.

The movement to limit car usage extends beyond Germany, reaching places like Paris, where environmental concerns led to a partial driving ban during days of intense smog. The restrictions targeted cars with even- or odd-numbered license plates on alternate days, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion. Such measures not only address environmental issues but also highlight the immediate impact of reduced car usage on urban traffic and air quality.

Moreover, the concept of a car-free day has gained traction globally, as seen in Bogota, Colombia. Millions of Colombians participated in a car-free day, opting for alternative transportation methods like buses, bikes, or walking. This annual event aims to promote alternative transportation, reduce smog, and decrease traffic congestion. The success of this initiative has inspired other cities, such as Cali and Valledupar, to join the cause.

The shift away from car-centric cultures is not limited to specific regions; even in the United States, there are signs of change. Recent studies suggest a decline in car ownership, driving, and licenses obtained. This shift is not solely attributed to economic factors but indicates a broader cultural change in attitudes toward personal vehicle ownership. As President Obama pursues ambitious goals to curb greenhouse gas emissions, this shift in behavior aligns with a potential decline in peak driving in the United States.

The implications of limiting car usage extend beyond individual lifestyle choices. With transportation being a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, reducing reliance on cars aligns with environmental goals. The potential decrease in car ownership has prompted some automobile companies to rebrand themselves as "mobility" companies, recognizing a shift toward more diverse transportation options.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are multifaceted, encompassing financial, environmental, and health benefits. Examples from Germany, France, Colombia, and the United States highlight the positive outcomes of smart planning and a reduced dependence on private cars. As communities worldwide explore alternatives to traditional car-centric living, the collective impact has the potential to create a more sustainable, healthier, and environmentally friendly future.

In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

EXAMPLE 1:
Driving cars can be a danger to humans, but also a threat to the Earth. The usage of cars has plummeted since recent topics of smog, and safety. Using a car to get from point A to point B is getting out of hand and unnecessary. Limiting car usage can help save money, it can also help prevent smog or other pollution, and can make humans live a healthier life style. By limiting car usage, you are changing your life style for the better.

Less car usage can play a major role in the way you live your life. One big part of your life it could change is financial issues. Without a car you wouldnt have to spend thousands of dollars on an overpriced vehicle. Also you could save money from not having to buy overly priced gas, or having to fix any car issues, such as an oil leak. In the passage, Paris bans driving due to smog , the author states," Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters." Without all of your money going down the drain, you could spend your money in a more helpful way. With the money that you don't have to spend with car trouble, someone could by a gym membership, or they could go and renovate their house the way that they have always wanted. Without spending loads of money on a car, gas, and car problems, you could spend your money on more important things such as paying of loans.

Less car usage could also help the environment dramtically. Because of the usage of cars the environment has been hugely effected. Since the environment has been greatly affected, so has the people. Smog has been becoming a result of the pollution that cars cause. In the passage, Paris bans driving due to smog, they state,"Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plugin cars." Not only is pollution affecting the environment, but it is also affecting the way that we live our lives, and the way that we make our livings. Without the use of cars income will increase rather than decrease. Also the smog is creating a hazard to everyone who has to work, or go to school. Without the use of cars there will be no more smog, or hazardess environments to worry about.

Besides money, and pollution, there are other important reasons why less car usage would be ideal. A main point of less car usage would be for health. The world has grown to be lazy, and as a result obesity is becoming a huge issue. Walking to work, or to school can not only help the environment, but also help your immune system, and weight loss. Instead of walking, another great form of exercise that will help the environment is riding your bike. Using these tips there will be less obesity, and less pollution, and grrenhouse gas in the world.

Even though that driving has decreased 23% in the last 8 years, it is our duty to insure that the world will once again be a safe environment for everyone to live in. To insure a safe environment, the usage of cars must decrease. If the usage of cars does not decrease our money will. Money won't be the only problem though, obesity, and also smog will increase. To help save the Earth humans must cut back on using their cars. The results will be life changing.

EXAMPLE 2:
Cars are a very big apart of our lives, we rely on the to get us from point A to point B. But what if we had no need for cars anymore? What if all we needed was a good source of public transportation. Cities around the world are doing just that, private motor transportation has a lot of cons. Smog in big global cities is building up more and more environmental issues are becoming big problems due to the routine use of cars. Traffic jams and overcrowding of roads is also another big problem. There are many ways us as humans are trying to cut down on our use of private motor transportation that benefit us in so many ways.

When everyone in a big city such as Parris for example uses their own cars to go from place to place they put harmful gasses into the atmosphere. After a while of everyone driving in a big city like paris the gases and smog build up and polute the air. Parris is one of the cities trying to dramatically cut down the use of cars and provide easy to use and affordable public transportation. Public transportation cuts down the amount of people on the road and positively impacts the environment and the air around the city.

Traffic jams and overcrowding of road ways prevents the use of cars to achieve its full potential. For every person that uses public transportation that is on less car on the roads if everyone in a city such as Bogota, Colombia where to stop all usage of private motor vehicles the amount of traffic jams and overcrowding would decrease dramatically. People in Bogota, Colombia are doing that very such thing every year the city bans all non public transportation vehicles and requires all residents to find their own way to comute to where they need to go this has been going on for three straight years now "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution" says businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza.

We as humans are always on the move but some of the ways we get from place to place may not be beniffical to us overtime. The good thing about this is that governments in cities and countrys around the world are finding bennifical ways to comute other than driving your own vheicle. Since 2005 the amout of people on the road in the U.S has droped significantly and continues to drop every year. Public transportation and better laid out city plans are helping this drop in the usage of cars.

Cars get us from place to place but it would be nice if one day we wouldnt have to worry about the usage of cars i our world. With all of the banifits of not continuisly driving the world would be such a better place. One day this dream for many will become the way we all learn to live. Non reliant on private transportation.

Living without cars presents numerous advantages that extend beyond personal convenience to encompass economic, environmental, and health benefits. Across the globe, communities are experimenting with limiting car usage, leading to transformative changes in urban planning and individual lifestyles.

Financial considerations stand out as a compelling reason to embrace a life without cars. The burden of car ownership, including the purchase cost, maintenance, and fuel expenses, can strain household budgets. For instance, in the German suburb of Vauban, residents have chosen to forgo private vehicles, resulting in financial relief. With the absence of car-related expenditures, individuals can redirect funds towards essential needs, investments, or leisure activities. The notion that less reliance on cars can translate into improved economic well-being is echoed in various regions, including the United States.

Environmental concerns represent another critical driver for limiting car usage. The detrimental impact of cars on air quality and the environment is underscored by examples such as Paris, where smog reached alarming levels, prompting the implementation of a partial driving ban. Car emissions, a major contributor to greenhouse gas pollution, necessitate a reevaluation of urban development and transportation practices. Vauban's car-free streets symbolize a shift towards environmentally conscious living, fostering a model that prioritizes sustainable alternatives over car-dependent lifestyles.

Moreover, reducing car usage aligns with broader public health objectives. Embracing alternatives such as walking, cycling, or utilizing public transportation promotes physical activity and reduces sedentary behavior. The correlation between car-centric environments and rising obesity rates is addressed by initiatives like Bogota's car-free day. Beyond the immediate health benefits, an active lifestyle contributes to a sense of well-being and community engagement, fostering a positive societal shift.

While some may reminisce about the idyllic suburban dream of private cars and spacious garages, the changing landscape of urban planning calls for a reevaluation of such ideals. Initiatives like the car-reduced communities promoted by the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States and the shift towards public transport in Bogota reflect a growing consensus that prioritizes smarter, more sustainable planning over car-centric development.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage extend across economic, environmental, and health dimensions. The examples from Vauban, Paris, and Bogota illustrate the transformative potential of reimagining urban landscapes and individual lifestyles. Embracing alternatives to private cars emerges not only as a practical solution to financial burdens but also as a crucial step towards creating healthier, more sustainable communities. The global movement towards car-reduced living represents a paradigm shift that emphasizes the interconnectedness of personal choices with broader societal and environmental well-being.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars.

But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said.

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

Even though that driving has decreased 23% in the last 8 years, it is our duty to insure that the world will once again be a safe environment for everyone to live in. To insure a safe environment, the usage of cars must decrease. If the usage of cars does not decrease our money will. Money won't be the only problem though, obesity, and also smog will increase. To help save the Earth humans must cut back on using their cars. The results will be life changing.

EXAMPLE 2:
Cars are a very big apart of our lives, we rely on the to get us from point A to point B. But what if we had no need for cars anymore? What if all we needed was a good source of public transportation. Cities around the world are doing just that, private motor transportation has a lot of cons. Smog in big global cities is building up more and more environmental issues are becoming big problems due to the routine use of cars. Traffic jams and overcrowding of roads is also another big problem. There are many ways us as humans are trying to cut down on our use of private motor transportation that benefit us in so many ways.

When everyone in a big city such as Parris for example uses their own cars to go from place to place they put harmful gasses into the atmosphere. After a while of everyone driving in a big city like paris the gases and smog build up and polute the air. Parris is one of the cities trying to dramatically cut down the use of cars and provide easy to use and affordable public transportation. Public transportation cuts down the amount of people on the road and positively impacts the environment and the air around the city.

Traffic jams and overcrowding of road ways prevents the use of cars to achieve its full potential. For every person that uses public transportation that is on less car on the roads if everyone in a city such as Bogota, Colombia where to stop all usage of private motor vehicles the amount of traffic jams and overcrowding would decrease dramatically. People in Bogota, Colombia are doing that very such thing every year the city bans all non public transportation vehicles and requires all residents to find their own way to comute to where they need to go this has been going on for three straight years now "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution" says businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza.

We as humans are always on the move but some of the ways we get from place to place may not be beniffical to us overtime. The good thing about this is that governments in cities and countrys around the world are finding bennifical ways to comute other than driving your own vheicle. Since 2005 the amout of people on the road in the U.S has droped significantly and continues to drop every year. Public transportation and better laid out city plans are helping this drop in the usage of cars.

Cars get us from place to place but it would be nice if one day we wouldnt have to worry about the usage of cars i our world. With all of the banifits of not continuisly driving the world would be such a better place. One day this dream for many will become the way we all learn to live. Non reliant on private transportation.

In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage, with various communities and cities around the world experimenting with alternative modes of transportation and urban planning. This shift away from heavy reliance on cars is driven by multiple factors, including environmental concerns, financial considerations, and the desire for healthier and more sustainable lifestyles.

Financial implications play a significant role in the argument for limiting car usage. The cost associated with owning and maintaining a car, as highlighted in the example of Paris enforcing a driving ban to combat smog, can be substantial. The expenses related to car ownership, including fines, fuel, and maintenance, can add up quickly, placing a strain on individual budgets. By reducing dependence on cars, individuals can redirect their financial resources toward more meaningful and beneficial aspects of their lives, such as health and well-being.

Moreover, the environmental impact of car usage is a compelling reason for embracing alternative transportation methods. Greenhouse gas emissions from passenger cars contribute significantly to environmental pollution, and initiatives like the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, illustrate how communities can come together to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The negative effects of pollution on public health and the overall well-being of citizens underscore the importance of adopting sustainable transportation practices.

In addition to financial and environmental considerations, there is a crucial health aspect associated with limiting car usage. The sedentary lifestyle that often accompanies car dependence contributes to rising obesity rates. Encouraging alternative modes of transportation, such as walking or biking, as seen in the example of the car-free day in Bogota, can lead to a more active and healthier population. Embracing these alternatives not only benefits individuals but also promotes a culture of well-being and physical fitness.

The changing landscape of transportation is evident in various cities worldwide, as seen in Vauban, Germany, where car-free streets have become the norm, and in the United States, where there is a shift away from the traditional car-centric suburban development. These examples illustrate a global trend toward more sustainable and environmentally friendly urban planning.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers a multitude of advantages, ranging from financial savings to environmental conservation and improved public health. As communities and individuals embrace alternative transportation methods and smarter urban planning, the benefits extend beyond personal well-being to encompass a more sustainable and resilient future for our cities and the planet as a whole.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

EXAMPLE 1:
"All of our development since World War II has been centered around the car, and that will have to change," said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. David Goldberg says this in means of trying to decrease car usage, such as in Vauban, Germany. Car usage after World War II continued increasing for a long period of time until 2005 in the United States the number of miles driven started to decrease. In the year 2013, the miles driven in the United States decreased nearly 9% since 2005 and was equal to the amount of miles driven in 1995. Throughout the whole world people have been experiencing problems with air pollution and due to that many have been trying to decrease the usage of cars in different ways to slow this air pollution.

To start off, pollution from cars has been a large factor of the air pollution today. In the United States, 50 percent of the greenhouse emissions in the United States is caused by passenger cars. Then there is Paris who has been experiencing heavy smog. Recently, it has had days of nearrecord pollution. Reason for such high levels of smog or air pollution can be attributed to a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesel makes up 67% of vehicles in France. Then in the rest of Western Europe 53.3% of the vehicles are diesel.

Next, is how some people attempt to slow the car pollution. The first example of a community trying to decrease the usage of cars is Vauban, Germany. In Vaubaun street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden. For the most part, Vauban is car free. The only way to use cars in Vauban is to carpool because there is only two places to park in the whole city and they are two large parking garages on the edge of development. Then you have to pay 40,000 to keep a spot. 70% of the people in Vaubaun do not own cars. Anoter example is Paris, who is one of the biggest air pollutants next to Beijing. They have been trying to decrease the smog in their area through slowing the amount of cars on the road. What they did is make it so only cars wih evennumbered license plates could drive one day and oddnumbered license plates the next. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined due to this policy, which showed some reluctance in following the plan. This did not matter though because the smog cleared enough to where the polcy only lasted for one day. Another attempt in lowering the usage of cars was Bogota's carfree day. In this program it is quite obvious that it was just a day of no car usage at all. During this event Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work. Even in the rain people of Bogota participated in this event. Then there is one other case of lowering the usage of cars, which is the natural way, having people just grow away from the car. This is currently happening in the United States, one of if not the largest car users. Like I said earlier since 2005 the usage of cars has decreased. Whether this trend stays in motion or not depends on the idealism of the current and future generations.

To conclude, the use of cars is creating problems in air pollution and due to this there have been attempt to slow this usage. Then back to what David Goldberg said the development of the car needs to stop being the center of attention. So instead what we have to do is take our attention away from using the car to ways of finding ways to limit the cars use.

EXAMPLE 2:
studies have shown that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and 50 percent in the United States alone. Many people see this as and eye opener to life in the suburbs without motor vehicles. There have been actions on car deduced communities in Europe. Also France banned Driving do to smog. Sounds extreme, but it is very effective.

There have been some countries that have reduced the usage of cars to almost nothing. In Vauban, Germany Residents of this community have given up their cars. This may seem a bit insane, but the way the government did it is varry smart. Street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden. Their streets are completely " CarFree ". The government made it that if you still wanted a car you would have to pay an additional 40,000 for a spot when buying your home. The result is 70 percent of vaughn's Families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. In the United States, the EPA is promoting " " communities. Legislators are starting to act as well. Bogota has a carfree day where the only motor vehicles running are busses and taxis.

Some countries are even going to harsh measures by banning motor vehicles all togather. In France they had so much smog that they banned driveing all togather. France decided that they where going to order evennumbered license plates owners to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. Same for oddnumbered cars the following day. almost 4,000 drivers were fined, and 27 had their cars impounded because of their reaction to the fine. But congestion was down 60 percent in the capital. In Bogota, Colombia they have had three straight years where cars have been banned with only buses and tavis permitted in a capital of 7 million. Their goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced 25 fines. A businessman Carols Arturo Plaza said, "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." Based on all of the previous information givin, we can conclude that driving bans, and carfree campaigns have helped our environment. These countries have reduces the smog in their air. They have goten people to participate in their community. Also They have gotten other countries to get involved in this cause. Diffrent countries have Made their own style of these programs to their advantage. This idea of carfree suburbs is changing the way the population reacts in the community.

In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the detrimental impact of car usage on the environment, prompting innovative approaches to limit or even eliminate reliance on cars. This shift is not only evident in developed European countries but is also gaining momentum globally, including in the United States. The advantages of limiting car usage extend beyond environmental benefits, encompassing improved well-being, reduced stress, and innovative urban planning.

One noteworthy example is Vauban, Germany, where residents have become suburban pioneers by voluntarily giving up their cars. In this experimental district, streets are completely "car-free," except for the main thoroughfare serviced by a tram to downtown Freiburg. The residents of Vauban enjoy a more relaxed and joyful lifestyle, with 70 percent of families opting not to own cars, and 57 percent selling their cars to embrace this new way of living. The success of Vauban is part of a broader global trend towards "smart planning," which aims to separate suburban life from excessive auto use.

The environmental impact of automobiles cannot be overstated, especially in suburban areas where car dependence is deeply ingrained. In Europe, passenger cars contribute to 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in certain car-intensive areas in the United States, this figure can skyrocket to 50 percent. Recognizing the need for change, planners are adopting Vauban's principles worldwide, striving to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation. In this new paradigm, stores are strategically located within walking distance, fostering a sense of community and reducing the need for extensive parking spaces.

David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, emphasizes the necessity of shifting away from car-centric development that has dominated since World War II. This sentiment aligns with the goals set by the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States, which actively promotes "car reduced" communities. The effort to create communities less dependent on cars is a crucial step in addressing the substantial contribution of transportation to greenhouse gas emissions.

Additional evidence of successful initiatives to limit car usage can be found in Paris, where a partial driving ban was enforced to combat smog. Although initially met with resistance, the ban led to a significant reduction in congestion, demonstrating the potential positive impact of restricting car usage, even temporarily. Similarly, Bogota's annual car-free day has become a resounding success, with millions of Colombians embracing alternative transportation methods to reduce smog and alleviate traffic congestion.

Moreover, recent studies indicate a potential shift in American behavior regarding car ownership and usage. The United States, once a symbol of car culture, has seen a decline in the number of miles driven per person since 2005. Societal changes, such as the rise of telecommuting facilitated by the internet, the renewal of city centers, and the popularity of car-sharing programs, contribute to this cultural shift. Younger generations, in particular, are less inclined to prioritize car ownership, reflecting a changing attitude towards transportation.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers a myriad of advantages, ranging from environmental sustainability to enhanced quality of life. The global shift towards smart planning and the adoption of car-reduced communities reflect a growing awareness of the need to address the environmental impact of cars. Initiatives in Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate that innovative approaches can successfully reduce car dependency while promoting alternative and sustainable transportation methods. As the world collectively moves away from the car-centric development of the past, these endeavors represent a positive step towards a more sustainable and resilient future.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

EXAMPLE 1:
"All of our development since World War II has been centered around the car, and that will have to change," said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. David Goldberg says this in means of trying to decrease car usage, such as in Vauban, Germany. Car usage after World War II continued increasing for a long period of time until 2005 in the United States the number of miles driven started to decrease. In the year 2013, the miles driven in the United States decreased nearly 9% since 2005 and was equal to the amount of miles driven in 1995. Throughout the whole world people have been experiencing problems with air pollution and due to that many have been trying to decrease the usage of cars in different ways to slow this air pollution.

To start off, pollution from cars has been a large factor of the air pollution today. In the United States, 50 percent of the greenhouse emissions in the United States is caused by passenger cars. Then there is Paris who has been experiencing heavy smog. Recently, it has had days of nearrecord pollution. Reason for such high levels of smog or air pollution can be attributed to a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesel makes up 67% of vehicles in France. Then in the rest of Western Europe 53.3% of the vehicles are diesel.

Next, is how some people attempt to slow the car pollution. The first example of a community trying to decrease the usage of cars is Vauban, Germany. In Vaubaun street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden. For the most part, Vauban is car free. The only way to use cars in Vauban is to carpool because there is only two places to park in the whole city and they are two large parking garages on the edge of development. Then you have to pay 40,000 to keep a spot. 70% of the people in Vaubaun do not own cars. Anoter example is Paris, who is one of the biggest air pollutants next to Beijing. They have been trying to decrease the smog in their area through slowing the amount of cars on the road. What they did is make it so only cars wih evennumbered license plates could drive one day and oddnumbered license plates the next. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined due to this policy, which showed some reluctance in following the plan. This did not matter though because the smog cleared enough to where the polcy only lasted for one day. Another attempt in lowering the usage of cars was Bogota's carfree day. In this program it is quite obvious that it was just a day of no car usage at all. During this event Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work. Even in the rain people of Bogota participated in this event. Then there is one other case of lowering the usage of cars, which is the natural way, having people just grow away from the car. This is currently happening in the United States, one of if not the largest car users. Like I said earlier since 2005 the usage of cars has decreased. Whether this trend stays in motion or not depends on the idealism of the current and future generations.

To conclude, the use of cars is creating problems in air pollution and due to this there have been attempt to slow this usage. Then back to what David Goldberg said the development of the car needs to stop being the center of attention. So instead what we have to do is take our attention away from using the car to ways of finding ways to limit the cars use.

EXAMPLE 2:
studies have shown that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and 50 percent in the United States alone. Many people see this as and eye opener to life in the suburbs without motor vehicles. There have been actions on car deduced communities in Europe. Also France banned Driving do to smog. Sounds extreme, but it is very effective.

There have been some countries that have reduced the usage of cars to almost nothing. In Vauban, Germany Residents of this community have given up their cars. This may seem a bit insane, but the way the government did it is varry smart. Street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden. Their streets are completely " CarFree ". The government made it that if you still wanted a car you would have to pay an additional 40,000 for a spot when buying your home. The result is 70 percent of vaughn's Families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. In the United States, the EPA is promoting " " communities. Legislators are starting to act as well. Bogota has a carfree day where the only motor vehicles running are busses and taxis.

Some countries are even going to harsh measures by banning motor vehicles all togather. In France they had so much smog that they banned driveing all togather. France decided that they where going to order evennumbered license plates owners to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. Same for oddnumbered cars the following day. almost 4,000 drivers were fined, and 27 had their cars impounded because of their reaction to the fine. But congestion was down 60 percent in the capital. In Bogota, Colombia they have had three straight years where cars have been banned with only buses and tavis permitted in a capital of 7 million. Their goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced 25 fines. A businessman Carols Arturo Plaza said, "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." Based on all of the previous information givin, we can conclude that driving bans, and carfree campaigns have helped our environment. These countries have reduces the smog in their air. They have goten people to participate in their community. Also They have gotten other countries to get involved in this cause. Diffrent countries have Made their own style of these programs to their advantage. This idea of carfree suburbs is changing the way the population reacts in the community.

## ChatGPT
In recent years, there has been a growing movement around the world to limit car usage, driven by concerns about air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and the need for more sustainable urban planning. The advantages of reducing reliance on cars are evident in various examples from different parts of the world, such as Vauban in Germany, Paris, and Bogota in Colombia. These examples illustrate how limiting car usage can lead to environmental benefits, healthier communities, and innovative urban planning.

One striking example is Vauban, Germany, where residents have willingly given up their cars, embracing a car-free lifestyle. In this experimental community, street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a space costs $40,000. As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. The community serves as an example of "smart planning," reflecting a broader trend in Europe, the United States, and beyond to separate suburban life from auto use.

The environmental impact of car usage is a significant driver behind these initiatives. In Europe, passenger cars contribute to 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, rising to a staggering 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Efforts to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation aim to address this issue. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is actively promoting "car-reduced" communities, and there is growing support for public transport serving suburbs as part of federal transportation bills.

Paris provides another example of a city taking bold measures to combat air pollution. Faced with near-record pollution levels, Paris enforced a partial driving ban, alternating between even and odd-numbered license plates on different days. The ban resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion, showcasing the effectiveness of short-term measures to address immediate air quality concerns.

Bogota's annual car-free day demonstrates the positive impact of alternative transportation. Millions of Colombians participate by hiking, biking, skating, or taking buses to work, leaving the streets eerily devoid of traffic jams. The success of this event, now spreading to other countries, highlights the potential for cultural shifts in transportation habits.

The decreasing trend in car usage in the United States, as indicated by fewer miles driven, suggests a fundamental change in American behavior. If this trend persists, it could have positive implications for carbon emissions and the environment. The rise of telecommuting, improved public transportation, and changing preferences among younger generations contribute to this shift away from car-centric culture.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has tangible benefits for both the environment and communities. Examples from Vauban, Paris, and Bogota showcase the potential for innovative urban planning, reduced air pollution, and healthier lifestyles. As the world grapples with the environmental impact of car culture, these initiatives provide valuable lessons for shaping more sustainable and livable cities.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

In recent years, there has been a growing global movement towards limiting car usage, driven by concerns about air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and the need for more sustainable urban planning. This shift is evident in various initiatives around the world, each offering valuable insights into the advantages of reducing reliance on automobiles.

One notable example is Vauban, Germany, where residents have become suburban pioneers by willingly giving up their cars. In this experimental community, street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden, making Vauban's streets essentially "car-free." Car ownership is allowed, but with only two designated parking spaces available at the edge of the development, priced at a hefty $40,000 each. Consequently, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. This innovative approach showcases a commitment to a low-car suburban life, challenging the conventional dependence on automobiles.

The environmental impact of car usage is a significant concern addressed by these initiatives. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this figure rises to a staggering 50 percent. In response, planners are adopting "smart planning" strategies, aiming to separate suburban life from excessive auto use. The focus is on creating more compact communities with better access to public transportation, challenging the traditional suburban model centered around car dependence.

Paris, facing severe smog issues, implemented a partial driving ban based on license plate numbers. Odd- and even-numbered plates were restricted on alternating days, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion and a noticeable improvement in air quality. While such measures may seem extreme, they underscore the urgency of addressing the environmental impact of car emissions.

Bogota, Colombia, takes a different approach with its annual "Car-free Day," where millions of citizens embrace alternative transportation methods, such as hiking, biking, or taking buses. This initiative, now spreading to other countries, aims to reduce smog and promote sustainable commuting. The success of this program demonstrates the feasibility of alternative transportation and its positive effects on both air quality and stress reduction.

Moreover, the United States is experiencing a cultural shift away from car dependency. Studies indicate a decrease in the number of miles driven per person, suggesting that Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less. This trend, if sustained, could significantly contribute to reducing carbon emissions, aligning with President Obama's goals to curb greenhouse gas emissions.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers a range of environmental, health, and community benefits. From car-free communities in Germany to driving bans in Paris and car-free days in Bogota, these initiatives demonstrate the global momentum towards a more sustainable and less car-dependent future. As societies grapple with the environmental consequences of car culture, innovative approaches and a shift in mindset become essential components of creating a healthier and more sustainable world.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

EXAMPLE 1:
"All of our development since World War II has been centered around the car, and that will have to change," said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. David Goldberg says this in means of trying to decrease car usage, such as in Vauban, Germany. Car usage after World War II continued increasing for a long period of time until 2005 in the United States the number of miles driven started to decrease. In the year 2013, the miles driven in the United States decreased nearly 9% since 2005 and was equal to the amount of miles driven in 1995. Throughout the whole world people have been experiencing problems with air pollution and due to that many have been trying to decrease the usage of cars in different ways to slow this air pollution.

To start off, pollution from cars has been a large factor of the air pollution today. In the United States, 50 percent of the greenhouse emissions in the United States is caused by passenger cars. Then there is Paris who has been experiencing heavy smog. Recently, it has had days of nearrecord pollution. Reason for such high levels of smog or air pollution can be attributed to a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesel makes up 67% of vehicles in France. Then in the rest of Western Europe 53.3% of the vehicles are diesel.

Next, is how some people attempt to slow the car pollution. The first example of a community trying to decrease the usage of cars is Vauban, Germany. In Vaubaun street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden. For the most part, Vauban is car free. The only way to use cars in Vauban is to carpool because there is only two places to park in the whole city and they are two large parking garages on the edge of development. Then you have to pay 40,000 to keep a spot. 70% of the people in Vaubaun do not own cars. Anoter example is Paris, who is one of the biggest air pollutants next to Beijing. They have been trying to decrease the smog in their area through slowing the amount of cars on the road. What they did is make it so only cars wih evennumbered license plates could drive one day and oddnumbered license plates the next. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined due to this policy, which showed some reluctance in following the plan. This did not matter though because the smog cleared enough to where the polcy only lasted for one day. Another attempt in lowering the usage of cars was Bogota's carfree day. In this program it is quite obvious that it was just a day of no car usage at all. During this event Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work. Even in the rain people of Bogota participated in this event. Then there is one other case of lowering the usage of cars, which is the natural way, having people just grow away from the car. This is currently happening in the United States, one of if not the largest car users. Like I said earlier since 2005 the usage of cars has decreased. Whether this trend stays in motion or not depends on the idealism of the current and future generations.

To conclude, the use of cars is creating problems in air pollution and due to this there have been attempt to slow this usage. Then back to what David Goldberg said the development of the car needs to stop being the center of attention. So instead what we have to do is take our attention away from using the car to ways of finding ways to limit the cars use.

EXAMPLE 2:
studies have shown that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and 50 percent in the United States alone. Many people see this as and eye opener to life in the suburbs without motor vehicles. There have been actions on car deduced communities in Europe. Also France banned Driving do to smog. Sounds extreme, but it is very effective.

There have been some countries that have reduced the usage of cars to almost nothing. In Vauban, Germany Residents of this community have given up their cars. This may seem a bit insane, but the way the government did it is varry smart. Street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden. Their streets are completely " CarFree ". The government made it that if you still wanted a car you would have to pay an additional 40,000 for a spot when buying your home. The result is 70 percent of vaughn's Families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. In the United States, the EPA is promoting " " communities. Legislators are starting to act as well. Bogota has a carfree day where the only motor vehicles running are busses and taxis.

Some countries are even going to harsh measures by banning motor vehicles all togather. In France they had so much smog that they banned driveing all togather. France decided that they where going to order evennumbered license plates owners to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. Same for oddnumbered cars the following day. almost 4,000 drivers were fined, and 27 had their cars impounded because of their reaction to the fine. But congestion was down 60 percent in the capital. In Bogota, Colombia they have had three straight years where cars have been banned with only buses and tavis permitted in a capital of 7 million. Their goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced 25 fines. A businessman Carols Arturo Plaza said, "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." Based on all of the previous information givin, we can conclude that driving bans, and carfree campaigns have helped our environment. These countries have reduces the smog in their air. They have goten people to participate in their community. Also They have gotten other countries to get involved in this cause. Diffrent countries have Made their own style of these programs to their advantage. This idea of carfree suburbs is changing the way the population reacts in the community.

In recent years, there has been a growing global movement to limit car usage, driven by concerns about air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and the need for more sustainable urban planning. This shift is exemplified by various initiatives and experiments in different parts of the world, as outlined in the provided passages.

One notable example is the German suburb of Vauban, where residents have embraced a car-free lifestyle. In Vauban, street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden, and the streets are designed to be completely "car-free." Car ownership is allowed, but the limited parking spaces available come at a high cost – $40,000 for a spot along with a home. The result is that 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their cars to move to this experimental community. This case demonstrates a successful implementation of "smart planning," an emerging trend in Europe and the United States aimed at reducing dependence on cars in suburban areas.

The need for such initiatives is underscored by the significant contribution of passenger cars to greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, automobiles are responsible for 12 percent of these emissions, and the figure rises to 50 percent in certain car-intensive areas of the United States. This heavy reliance on cars, particularly in suburban settings, poses a substantial obstacle to efforts aimed at curbing emissions and mitigating climate change.

Paris, a global city grappling with near-record pollution, took a drastic step to address the issue by enforcing a partial driving ban. The city implemented a system where motorists with even-numbered license plates were allowed to drive on certain days, while those with odd-numbered plates could drive on alternate days. This temporary ban led to a 60 percent reduction in congestion, demonstrating the immediate impact of restricting car usage in response to environmental challenges.

Beyond Europe, Bogota, Colombia, embraced a car-free day as part of a broader campaign to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Millions of Colombians participated, hiking, biking, skating, or taking buses to work. This annual event, which has expanded to other Colombian cities, highlights the success of a broader effort that began in the mid-1990s. The campaign in Bogota has resulted in the creation of bicycle paths, restrictions on rush-hour traffic, and the development of new public spaces, illustrating a comprehensive approach to reimagining urban mobility.

In the United States, there are signs of a cultural shift away from car-centric lifestyles. Studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and obtaining fewer licenses. This trend, if it persists, could have positive implications for reducing carbon emissions. Younger generations, in particular, seem less inclined to prioritize car ownership, preferring alternative modes of transportation such as walking, public transit, and shared services.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are multifaceted and extend beyond environmental benefits. Initiatives like those in Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and the changing trends in the United States point to a global reevaluation of the role of cars in our lives. From reducing air pollution to fostering more sustainable urban planning, these efforts showcase the potential for a future where suburban life is less dependent on automobiles. As we navigate the challenges of climate change and environmental sustainability, embracing alternative modes of transportation and reimagining our communities without an overreliance on cars becomes increasingly crucial.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

EXAMPLE 1:
"All of our development since World War II has been centered around the car, and that will have to change," said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. David Goldberg says this in means of trying to decrease car usage, such as in Vauban, Germany. Car usage after World War II continued increasing for a long period of time until 2005 in the United States the number of miles driven started to decrease. In the year 2013, the miles driven in the United States decreased nearly 9% since 2005 and was equal to the amount of miles driven in 1995. Throughout the whole world people have been experiencing problems with air pollution and due to that many have been trying to decrease the usage of cars in different ways to slow this air pollution.

To start off, pollution from cars has been a large factor of the air pollution today. In the United States, 50 percent of the greenhouse emissions in the United States is caused by passenger cars. Then there is Paris who has been experiencing heavy smog. Recently, it has had days of nearrecord pollution. Reason for such high levels of smog or air pollution can be attributed to a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesel makes up 67% of vehicles in France. Then in the rest of Western Europe 53.3% of the vehicles are diesel.

Next, is how some people attempt to slow the car pollution. The first example of a community trying to decrease the usage of cars is Vauban, Germany. In Vaubaun street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden. For the most part, Vauban is car free. The only way to use cars in Vauban is to carpool because there is only two places to park in the whole city and they are two large parking garages on the edge of development. Then you have to pay 40,000 to keep a spot. 70% of the people in Vaubaun do not own cars. Anoter example is Paris, who is one of the biggest air pollutants next to Beijing. They have been trying to decrease the smog in their area through slowing the amount of cars on the road. What they did is make it so only cars wih evennumbered license plates could drive one day and oddnumbered license plates the next. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined due to this policy, which showed some reluctance in following the plan. This did not matter though because the smog cleared enough to where the polcy only lasted for one day. Another attempt in lowering the usage of cars was Bogota's carfree day. In this program it is quite obvious that it was just a day of no car usage at all. During this event Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work. Even in the rain people of Bogota participated in this event. Then there is one other case of lowering the usage of cars, which is the natural way, having people just grow away from the car. This is currently happening in the United States, one of if not the largest car users. Like I said earlier since 2005 the usage of cars has decreased. Whether this trend stays in motion or not depends on the idealism of the current and future generations.

To conclude, the use of cars is creating problems in air pollution and due to this there have been attempt to slow this usage. Then back to what David Goldberg said the development of the car needs to stop being the center of attention. So instead what we have to do is take our attention away from using the car to ways of finding ways to limit the cars use.

EXAMPLE 2:
studies have shown that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and 50 percent in the United States alone. Many people see this as and eye opener to life in the suburbs without motor vehicles. There have been actions on car deduced communities in Europe. Also France banned Driving do to smog. Sounds extreme, but it is very effective.

There have been some countries that have reduced the usage of cars to almost nothing. In Vauban, Germany Residents of this community have given up their cars. This may seem a bit insane, but the way the government did it is varry smart. Street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden. Their streets are completely " CarFree ". The government made it that if you still wanted a car you would have to pay an additional 40,000 for a spot when buying your home. The result is 70 percent of vaughn's Families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. In the United States, the EPA is promoting " " communities. Legislators are starting to act as well. Bogota has a carfree day where the only motor vehicles running are busses and taxis.

Some countries are even going to harsh measures by banning motor vehicles all togather. In France they had so much smog that they banned driveing all togather. France decided that they where going to order evennumbered license plates owners to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. Same for oddnumbered cars the following day. almost 4,000 drivers were fined, and 27 had their cars impounded because of their reaction to the fine. But congestion was down 60 percent in the capital. In Bogota, Colombia they have had three straight years where cars have been banned with only buses and tavis permitted in a capital of 7 million. Their goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced 25 fines. A businessman Carols Arturo Plaza said, "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." Based on all of the previous information givin, we can conclude that driving bans, and carfree campaigns have helped our environment. These countries have reduces the smog in their air. They have goten people to participate in their community. Also They have gotten other countries to get involved in this cause. Diffrent countries have Made their own style of these programs to their advantage. This idea of carfree suburbs is changing the way the population reacts in the community.

The need to limit car usage has become a pressing concern as the negative impacts of automobile dependency on the environment and public health are increasingly evident. The suburban experiment in Vauban, Germany, serves as a compelling example of a community successfully transitioning away from car-centric living. In this upscale district, residents have pioneered a lifestyle that goes beyond the conventional, embracing a "car-free" ethos. Streets in Vauban are off-limits to conventional parking, driveways, and home garages, with car ownership allowed only for those who purchase parking spaces at a considerable cost.

The success of Vauban's endeavor is reflected in the fact that 70 percent of its families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their cars to move to this innovative community. This transformation has led to a significant improvement in residents' well-being, with one inhabitant attesting to feeling happier and less tense without the burden of car ownership. Vauban, completed in 2006, exemplifies a broader global trend of moving away from car-centric living, often referred to as "smart planning."

The environmental imperative to limit car usage is underscored by the significant role automobiles play in suburban life, where middle-class families predominantly choose car-dependent lifestyles. According to experts, passenger cars contribute to 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some highly car-intensive areas of the United States. As part of a larger movement towards sustainability, planners are now working to reshape suburbs, making them more compact and accessible to public transportation while reducing the need for extensive parking spaces.

David Goldberg, an official from Transportation for America, emphasizes the necessity of changing the focus of development, stating, "All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change." This sentiment is echoed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the United States, which actively promotes "car-reduced" communities. Legislative efforts are also underway to shift transportation funding towards public transit in federal bills.

Beyond Europe and the United States, Bogota, Colombia, has implemented a successful car-free day for three consecutive years. Millions of Colombians actively participated in the initiative, opting for alternative modes of transportation such as hiking, biking, skating, or using buses. The event aims to reduce smog and promote sustainable transportation, with violators facing fines.

Furthermore, the decline in car usage is observed on a larger scale in the United States. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and obtaining fewer licenses. This shift in behavior raises the question of whether the United States has reached "peak driving." Factors contributing to this change include advancements in technology facilitating telecommuting, the revitalization of city centers, and the rise of shared transportation services.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has become an imperative for addressing environmental concerns and enhancing the overall quality of life. The examples from Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and the broader trend in the United States highlight the success and potential of transitioning away from car-centric living. As societies embrace alternative transportation and smart planning, they pave the way for a more sustainable and environmentally friendly future.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage in various parts of the world, driven by concerns about environmental sustainability and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This shift is evident in communities like Vauban, Germany, where residents have embraced a car-free lifestyle as part of an experimental approach to suburban living. The advantages of limiting car usage are multifaceted, ranging from environmental benefits to improvements in overall well-being.

One compelling reason to limit car usage is the significant role automobiles play in environmental pollution. Elisabeth Rosenthal, in her article on Vauban, highlights that passenger cars are responsible for a substantial portion of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to environmental degradation. In Europe, cars account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some U.S. areas, this figure rises to a staggering 50 percent. These statistics underscore the urgency of adopting alternative approaches to suburban living that are less dependent on individual car ownership.

Vauban, with its car-free streets and limited parking options, serves as a pioneering example of how communities can break free from the conventional reliance on cars. In this German suburb, streets are designed to be "car-free," except for a main thoroughfare accommodating public transportation. Residents are permitted to own cars, but the community's design discourages car usage by restricting parking to large garages on the outskirts of the development. This approach has led to a remarkable outcome: 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their cars to move to this innovative community.

The movement to limit car usage extends beyond Europe, as exemplified by actions taken in Paris and Bogota. Paris, grappling with severe smog, implemented a partial driving ban based on license plate numbers, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion. Similarly, Bogota has embraced a car-free day, with millions of Colombians opting for alternative transportation methods, such as walking, biking, skating, or taking buses. These initiatives not only address environmental concerns but also contribute to reducing traffic congestion and promoting healthier, more sustainable urban living.

In the United States, efforts are underway to reshape suburban development and reduce dependence on cars. David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, emphasizes the need to shift away from car-centric development that has prevailed since World War II. As President Obama introduces ambitious goals to curb greenhouse gas emissions, there is a growing recognition that the traditional model of car culture needs to be reconsidered. Studies suggest a decline in car ownership and driving, indicating a potential cultural shift in how people view personal transportation.

While some may view these changes as radical, they align with a broader global trend towards sustainable living. The decrease in car usage is not solely an environmental necessity but also a reflection of evolving societal attitudes. Factors such as increased connectivity through the internet, the renewal of city centers, and the rise of alternative transportation options contribute to this shift. As younger generations show less interest in obtaining driver's licenses and prioritize alternative commuting methods, the traditional concept of car culture faces potential obsolescence.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers a range of advantages, from mitigating environmental impacts to fostering healthier and more sustainable communities. Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and the evolving trends in the United States collectively demonstrate that alternative approaches to transportation are not only viable but also essential for the well-being of our planet and future generations. As we move forward, it is crucial to embrace smart planning and innovative urban designs that prioritize public transportation, reduce the need for personal cars, and create communities where people can thrive without being overly dependent on automobiles.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

EXAMPLE 1:
"All of our development since World War II has been centered around the car, and that will have to change," said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. David Goldberg says this in means of trying to decrease car usage, such as in Vauban, Germany. Car usage after World War II continued increasing for a long period of time until 2005 in the United States the number of miles driven started to decrease. In the year 2013, the miles driven in the United States decreased nearly 9% since 2005 and was equal to the amount of miles driven in 1995. Throughout the whole world people have been experiencing problems with air pollution and due to that many have been trying to decrease the usage of cars in different ways to slow this air pollution.

To start off, pollution from cars has been a large factor of the air pollution today. In the United States, 50 percent of the greenhouse emissions in the United States is caused by passenger cars. Then there is Paris who has been experiencing heavy smog. Recently, it has had days of nearrecord pollution. Reason for such high levels of smog or air pollution can be attributed to a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesel makes up 67% of vehicles in France. Then in the rest of Western Europe 53.3% of the vehicles are diesel.

Next, is how some people attempt to slow the car pollution. The first example of a community trying to decrease the usage of cars is Vauban, Germany. In Vaubaun street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden. For the most part, Vauban is car free. The only way to use cars in Vauban is to carpool because there is only two places to park in the whole city and they are two large parking garages on the edge of development. Then you have to pay 40,000 to keep a spot. 70% of the people in Vaubaun do not own cars. Anoter example is Paris, who is one of the biggest air pollutants next to Beijing. They have been trying to decrease the smog in their area through slowing the amount of cars on the road. What they did is make it so only cars wih evennumbered license plates could drive one day and oddnumbered license plates the next. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined due to this policy, which showed some reluctance in following the plan. This did not matter though because the smog cleared enough to where the polcy only lasted for one day. Another attempt in lowering the usage of cars was Bogota's carfree day. In this program it is quite obvious that it was just a day of no car usage at all. During this event Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work. Even in the rain people of Bogota participated in this event. Then there is one other case of lowering the usage of cars, which is the natural way, having people just grow away from the car. This is currently happening in the United States, one of if not the largest car users. Like I said earlier since 2005 the usage of cars has decreased. Whether this trend stays in motion or not depends on the idealism of the current and future generations.

To conclude, the use of cars is creating problems in air pollution and due to this there have been attempt to slow this usage. Then back to what David Goldberg said the development of the car needs to stop being the center of attention. So instead what we have to do is take our attention away from using the car to ways of finding ways to limit the cars use.

EXAMPLE 2:
studies have shown that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and 50 percent in the United States alone. Many people see this as and eye opener to life in the suburbs without motor vehicles. There have been actions on car deduced communities in Europe. Also France banned Driving do to smog. Sounds extreme, but it is very effective.

There have been some countries that have reduced the usage of cars to almost nothing. In Vauban, Germany Residents of this community have given up their cars. This may seem a bit insane, but the way the government did it is varry smart. Street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden. Their streets are completely " CarFree ". The government made it that if you still wanted a car you would have to pay an additional 40,000 for a spot when buying your home. The result is 70 percent of vaughn's Families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. In the United States, the EPA is promoting " " communities. Legislators are starting to act as well. Bogota has a carfree day where the only motor vehicles running are busses and taxis.

Some countries are even going to harsh measures by banning motor vehicles all togather. In France they had so much smog that they banned driveing all togather. France decided that they where going to order evennumbered license plates owners to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. Same for oddnumbered cars the following day. almost 4,000 drivers were fined, and 27 had their cars impounded because of their reaction to the fine. But congestion was down 60 percent in the capital. In Bogota, Colombia they have had three straight years where cars have been banned with only buses and tavis permitted in a capital of 7 million. Their goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced 25 fines. A businessman Carols Arturo Plaza said, "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." Based on all of the previous information givin, we can conclude that driving bans, and carfree campaigns have helped our environment. These countries have reduces the smog in their air. They have goten people to participate in their community. Also They have gotten other countries to get involved in this cause. Diffrent countries have Made their own style of these programs to their advantage. This idea of carfree suburbs is changing the way the population reacts in the community.

In recent years, there has been a growing global movement to limit car usage, driven by concerns about environmental sustainability and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This shift is not only about environmental awareness but also about redefining the way communities function and encouraging alternative modes of transportation. One notable example is the German suburb of Vauban, where residents have embraced a car-free lifestyle as a pioneering experiment in "smart planning."

Vauban stands out as a prime example of this trend, with streets that are completely "car-free" except for a main thoroughfare where a tram runs to downtown Freiburg. The community has taken bold steps to discourage car ownership, with restrictions on street parking, driveways, and home garages. Car owners are required to purchase a parking space at the edge of the development for a substantial fee of $40,000. As a result, an impressive 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their cars to move to this innovative suburb.

This experiment in Vauban is part of a broader movement seen not only in Europe but also in the United States and elsewhere. The traditional suburban lifestyle, centered around private car ownership and expansive driveways, is being reevaluated in favor of a more sustainable and compact model. As David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, notes, "All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."

One of the primary motivations behind limiting car usage is the significant role automobiles play in greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of these emissions, rising to a staggering 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Efforts to reduce these emissions have led to initiatives like the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, where millions of people embrace alternative transportation methods to promote environmental sustainability and reduce smog.

Paris, faced with near-record pollution levels, implemented a partial driving ban based on odd and even license plate numbers. While this drastic measure faced some resistance, it effectively reduced congestion in the city by 60 percent. Such interventions underscore the urgency of addressing the environmental impact of cars and the need for alternative, sustainable transportation solutions.

In the United States, there is a noticeable cultural shift away from car ownership and driving. Studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. The decrease in driving is not merely a consequence of the economic downturn but reflects a more fundamental change in behavior. This shift is not limited to specific age groups, as even younger generations show less interest in obtaining driver's licenses.

The implications of this shift extend beyond environmental benefits. While it poses challenges for the traditional car industry, it opens up opportunities for reimagining urban planning and transportation infrastructure. Car-sharing programs, bike-sharing initiatives, and improved public transportation are gaining traction. Ford Motor Company, for instance, envisions a future where personal vehicle ownership becomes impractical, advocating for a connected network that integrates various modes of transportation.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is a multifaceted initiative with environmental, cultural, and economic implications. The examples from Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and the broader trend observed in the United States all point to a global movement seeking alternatives to the car-centric suburban lifestyle. This shift is essential for mitigating the environmental impact of cars, reducing congestion, and redefining how communities approach transportation in the 21st century.

They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

EXAMPLE 1:
All across the globe, a revolutionary idea is being set in motion. The idea of essentially banning cars from the streets has sparked as much interest as it has critics. The automotive industry has been booming since World War 2, and although the positive effects of cars can be seen in our daily lives, we seldom take into consideration of the negative impacts of cars. Effects such as pollution, traffic, and cost have impacted our lives as automotive users, even if we have not realized it.

Pollution is one of the primary concerns of a world that is constantly driving, yet it is something people hardly take into account when driving. In theory that is understandable, considering the last thing a person is thinking about when they're driving is what their car is spitting out into the atmosphere. However pollution doesn't go unnoticed for long. For example, the city of Paris, France enforced a partial driving ban in order to decrease the almost record breaking pollution across the city, stating, "The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world." The smog did clear from the city and previous driving laws were reinstated, however this shows how car pollution has a negative impact on the world around us.

Another negative impact of driving is traffic. Traffic is a driver's worst nightmare, and it affects all of us at some point in our lives. In Bogota, Columbia, citizens participated in a drivingfree day, where everyone was encouraged to either hike, bike, skate, or use public transportation in order to reach their destination. This event, in which millions of Colombians participated, was reportedly "leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams." This program left a positive mark on the city of Bogota, and will hopefully soon spread to other countries, reducing crowded, traffic filled streets around the world.

The world runs on money, just ask any Wall Street broker. This is a paradox concerning both car owners and people looking to purchase a car. The question remains, if we're all trying to save money, why spend thousands of dollars on a costly car? According to a census taken in 2013, "Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cashstrapped Americans could not afford cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway." This shows that the number of people buying cars is steadily decreasing. Another costly problem of cars is fuel. Buying gasoline for your car every week can get incredibly costly, especially when driving a large truck or sports car. This shows how the cost of cars can have a negative impact on our lives.

In conclusion, the use of cars is steadily declining. Cars just aren't a very positive motive for transportation anymore considering the effects of pollution, traffic, and cost that cars produce.

EXAMPLE 2:
Millions of people use cars in their everyday lives whether its driving to work, school or even the supermarket. With the amount of people on the streets on a daily basis, its not surprising that there is a major traffic issue in Miami. Most people dont realise how big of an issue this truly is because in reality they just need to get to and from work. I'm here to inform you about the beneficial alternatives to driving everywhere you go.

Whether going to work or driving your kids to soccer practice, a way of transportation is a must. Most people choose the "easy" way out and just hop in their brand new luxury cars. But what if I told you there is an easier way, a more efficient way? All around Miami, there are metro rail stations. These stations are clean, safe, and not to mention useful. There are busses, troll's, and even metro movers that can take you all around the city. the trains, busses, troll's and metro movers all run on a schedule. An easy way to limit your gas bill, pollution and time wasted in traffic is to simply set up a route to where you need to go and catch the appropriate mose of transportation.

Time is always on peoples mind, whether you have enough time to go shopping for a new dress or maybe stop by grandmas house. all things require time. Everyday millions of Americans spend hours stuck in traffic due to rushhour. This means less time spent with family anymore time bonding with the annoying car horns constantly beeping. If you could switch to another mode of transportation you could cut time commuting in half. The Metro rail avoided all traffic regardless and if more people start thinking like this then the bus might soon be avoidingall traffic too. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two says "When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way." Everyday she walks verdant streets listening to the delightful sound of people chatting and children playing, something she was unable to appreciate with her windows rolled up as she drove around town.

So many fuel consuming vehicles on the street on a daily basis can't be too great for our environment, don't you think? It isnt, all this pollution is causing a nasty smog all over the world, some places more than others. Paris tends to have more smog than Europe but not too long ago, Paris had 147 micrograms or particulate matter per cubic meter compared to 114 in Brussels. This smog makes it difficult for dilivery companies to complete their jobs. This smog isnt good for us either just think about what you are breathing.

In recent years, a revolutionary idea has gained traction across the globe: limiting car usage for a more sustainable and efficient society. The advantages of such a shift are evident in various communities and cities worldwide, where innovative approaches to transportation have been embraced. This essay explores the benefits of limiting car usage, drawing insights from diverse sources that highlight the environmental, economic, and societal advantages of this emerging trend.

One of the primary concerns associated with widespread car usage is pollution, a critical issue addressed by communities implementing car-free initiatives. For instance, in Paris, faced with near-record pollution levels, authorities enforced a partial driving ban, resulting in a significant reduction in congestion and improved air quality. The negative impact of car emissions on the environment is a global concern, with cars responsible for a substantial percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and the United States.

Traffic congestion, another consequence of excessive car usage, plagues cities around the world, affecting both the environment and individuals' quality of life. The success of car-free initiatives is exemplified in Bogota, Colombia, where a car-free day led to a 60 percent reduction in congestion, demonstrating the potential for alternative transportation modes to alleviate traffic-related issues.

Beyond environmental concerns, limiting car usage can have positive economic implications. The cost associated with car ownership, including expenses for fuel, maintenance, and parking, can be a significant financial burden. With fewer individuals purchasing cars, as observed in the United States during the recession, there is a potential shift in consumer behavior that aligns with the principles of sustainable living and economic prudence.

Moreover, the decline in car ownership is indicative of a cultural shift, with younger generations exhibiting less interest in owning cars compared to previous decades. Factors such as advancements in technology, the rise of telecommuting, and the availability of alternative transportation options contribute to this shift. As the trend continues, there may be a reduced impact on carbon emissions and a transformation in the way societies view personal vehicle ownership.

In conclusion, limiting car usage emerges as a multifaceted solution to address environmental, economic, and societal challenges associated with widespread car dependency. Insights from various global initiatives, such as car-free days in Bogota and pollution-driven driving bans in Paris, underscore the positive impacts of alternative transportation methods. As communities explore and adopt innovative approaches to urban planning, the advantages of reducing reliance on cars become increasingly apparent, paving the way for a more sustainable and interconnected future.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

In today's rapidly changing world, where urbanization and environmental concerns are at the forefront, the idea of limiting car usage is gaining momentum. As exemplified by innovative communities such as Vauban in Germany, a suburb where car ownership is allowed but restricted, and Paris, which enforced a partial driving ban to combat pollution, these initiatives present a compelling case for reconsidering our reliance on cars.

One of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact on the environment, particularly in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. As highlighted in the passage, passenger cars contribute significantly to emissions, with 12 percent in Europe and up to 50 percent in certain car-intensive areas in the United States. By adopting a model like Vauban, where car ownership is discouraged and public transportation is emphasized, we can make substantial strides in minimizing our carbon footprint and mitigating the effects of climate change.

Another pressing issue that limiting car usage addresses is the problem of traffic congestion. The car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, serves as a successful example of how alternative transportation methods, such as buses and bicycles, can alleviate traffic jams. In a city of 7 million, the streets were reported to be "eerily devoid of traffic jams," showcasing the potential for reducing congestion and making urban areas more navigable for everyone.

Additionally, the economic benefits of limiting car usage should not be overlooked. As seen in the United States during the recession, when Americans faced financial constraints, car ownership and miles driven per person decreased. This not only reflects a shift in consumer behavior but also has positive implications for reducing overall transportation costs and dependence on expensive, fuel-consuming vehicles.

Furthermore, the trend of declining car ownership and driving habits, as discussed in "The End of Car Culture," suggests a cultural shift. Factors such as the rise of telecommuting, shared transportation services, and a renewed interest in city living contribute to this transformation. This shift not only aligns with President Obama's goals to curb greenhouse gas emissions but also prompts car manufacturers to reconsider their business models, focusing on mobility beyond personal vehicles.

In conclusion, limiting car usage emerges as a multifaceted solution addressing environmental, economic, and cultural concerns. As demonstrated by various global initiatives, from car-free days to innovative suburban planning, reevaluating our dependence on cars paves the way for a more sustainable and efficient future. By embracing alternative modes of transportation and fostering a cultural shift, we can create communities that are not only car-reduced but also more livable, eco-friendly, and economically viable.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

EXAMPLE 1:
All across the globe, a revolutionary idea is being set in motion. The idea of essentially banning cars from the streets has sparked as much interest as it has critics. The automotive industry has been booming since World War 2, and although the positive effects of cars can be seen in our daily lives, we seldom take into consideration of the negative impacts of cars. Effects such as pollution, traffic, and cost have impacted our lives as automotive users, even if we have not realized it.

Pollution is one of the primary concerns of a world that is constantly driving, yet it is something people hardly take into account when driving. In theory that is understandable, considering the last thing a person is thinking about when they're driving is what their car is spitting out into the atmosphere. However pollution doesn't go unnoticed for long. For example, the city of Paris, France enforced a partial driving ban in order to decrease the almost record breaking pollution across the city, stating, "The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world." The smog did clear from the city and previous driving laws were reinstated, however this shows how car pollution has a negative impact on the world around us.

Another negative impact of driving is traffic. Traffic is a driver's worst nightmare, and it affects all of us at some point in our lives. In Bogota, Columbia, citizens participated in a drivingfree day, where everyone was encouraged to either hike, bike, skate, or use public transportation in order to reach their destination. This event, in which millions of Colombians participated, was reportedly "leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams." This program left a positive mark on the city of Bogota, and will hopefully soon spread to other countries, reducing crowded, traffic filled streets around the world.

The world runs on money, just ask any Wall Street broker. This is a paradox concerning both car owners and people looking to purchase a car. The question remains, if we're all trying to save money, why spend thousands of dollars on a costly car? According to a census taken in 2013, "Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cashstrapped Americans could not afford cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway." This shows that the number of people buying cars is steadily decreasing. Another costly problem of cars is fuel. Buying gasoline for your car every week can get incredibly costly, especially when driving a large truck or sports car. This shows how the cost of cars can have a negative impact on our lives.

In conclusion, the use of cars is steadily declining. Cars just aren't a very positive motive for transportation anymore considering the effects of pollution, traffic, and cost that cars produce.

EXAMPLE 2:
Millions of people use cars in their everyday lives whether its driving to work, school or even the supermarket. With the amount of people on the streets on a daily basis, its not surprising that there is a major traffic issue in Miami. Most people dont realise how big of an issue this truly is because in reality they just need to get to and from work. I'm here to inform you about the beneficial alternatives to driving everywhere you go.

Whether going to work or driving your kids to soccer practice, a way of transportation is a must. Most people choose the "easy" way out and just hop in their brand new luxury cars. But what if I told you there is an easier way, a more efficient way? All around Miami, there are metro rail stations. These stations are clean, safe, and not to mention useful. There are busses, troll's, and even metro movers that can take you all around the city. the trains, busses, troll's and metro movers all run on a schedule. An easy way to limit your gas bill, pollution and time wasted in traffic is to simply set up a route to where you need to go and catch the appropriate mose of transportation.

Time is always on peoples mind, whether you have enough time to go shopping for a new dress or maybe stop by grandmas house. all things require time. Everyday millions of Americans spend hours stuck in traffic due to rushhour. This means less time spent with family anymore time bonding with the annoying car horns constantly beeping. If you could switch to another mode of transportation you could cut time commuting in half. The Metro rail avoided all traffic regardless and if more people start thinking like this then the bus might soon be avoidingall traffic too. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two says "When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way." Everyday she walks verdant streets listening to the delightful sound of people chatting and children playing, something she was unable to appreciate with her windows rolled up as she drove around town.

So many fuel consuming vehicles on the street on a daily basis can't be too great for our environment, don't you think? It isnt, all this pollution is causing a nasty smog all over the world, some places more than others. Paris tends to have more smog than Europe but not too long ago, Paris had 147 micrograms or particulate matter per cubic meter compared to 114 in Brussels. This smog makes it difficult for dilivery companies to complete their jobs. This smog isnt good for us either just think about what you are breathing.

In an era dominated by the convenience and ubiquity of automobiles, a groundbreaking concept is emerging globally—one that challenges the very essence of our car-centric culture. The idea of limiting car usage, as exemplified by innovative experiments in places like Vauban, Germany, heralds a future where suburban life becomes synonymous with reduced dependence on cars. This revolutionary shift, often referred to as "smart planning," holds numerous advantages that extend beyond individual lifestyle choices.

First and foremost, the limitation of car usage addresses a pressing concern that affects every corner of the globe—environmental pollution. Paris, France, faced with near-record pollution levels, resorted to a partial driving ban, showcasing the immediate need to curb emissions from vehicular traffic. Similarly, the Colombian capital, Bogota, implemented a car-free day, demonstrating that alternative modes of transportation could alleviate the burden of smog and promote a healthier urban environment.

Traffic congestion, a perennial woe for commuters worldwide, is another critical issue that limiting car usage seeks to address. The success of the car-free day in Bogota, where millions of Colombians opted for alternative transportation, resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion. This not only highlights the positive impact on traffic flow but also underscores the potential for widespread adoption of such initiatives to ease the daily grind of commuters.

Financial considerations play a significant role in the shift away from car-centric living. The economic burden of car ownership, with costs ranging from purchasing to fuel, is a tangible deterrent for many. The aftermath of the recession in the United States witnessed a decline in car purchases, indicating a reevaluation of priorities and financial prudence. As President Obama's greenhouse gas reduction goals align with changing behaviors, it raises the question—has America reached peak driving? This decline in driving, if sustained, bodes well for both the environment and personal finances.

Furthermore, the social fabric of communities is positively influenced by reduced car dependence. The Vauban model, with its emphasis on creating walkable neighborhoods and accessible public transportation, fosters a sense of community and well-being. Residents testify to an improved quality of life, free from the stress associated with car ownership.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage extend far beyond individual preferences. The environmental, social, and economic benefits of such a shift are evident in various global experiments. As societies grapple with the challenges posed by excessive car usage, embracing alternative modes of transportation becomes not only a choice but a necessity for a sustainable and harmonious future.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

In various parts of the world, a transformative movement is gaining traction—one that challenges the conventional reliance on cars and seeks to revolutionize urban and suburban life. The advantages of limiting car usage are multifaceted, encompassing environmental, social, and economic benefits. This essay explores the rationale behind reducing car dependency, drawing insights from diverse sources such as a car-free suburb in Germany, a driving ban in Paris, a car-free day in Bogota, and a broader cultural shift in the United States.

One of the primary motivations for limiting car usage lies in addressing the environmental impact of automobiles. As exemplified by the upscale community of Vauban in Germany, where car ownership is allowed but severely restricted, residents have embraced a car-free lifestyle. The reduction in car ownership directly contributes to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions—a crucial consideration in combating climate change. According to experts, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of emissions, ranging from 12 percent in Europe to a staggering 50 percent in some car-intensive areas of the United States. This underscores the urgent need to separate suburban life from excessive car use, a trend observed not only in Europe but also gaining momentum in the United States.

Furthermore, instances such as the driving ban in Paris during periods of smog highlight the immediate benefits of restricting car usage. Paris, facing near-record pollution levels, implemented a partial driving ban based on license plate numbers. The result was a 60 percent reduction in congestion, demonstrating the positive impact of curbing car usage on air quality and public health. Such measures showcase the adaptability of urban environments to prioritize alternatives to individual car ownership, including public transportation and shared mobility solutions.

The global trend toward limiting car usage extends beyond Europe and the United States. Bogota, Colombia, has successfully implemented a car-free day for three consecutive years, with millions participating in alternative modes of transportation. This initiative, aimed at reducing smog and promoting sustainable transportation, illustrates the potential for widespread adoption of car-free practices, even in densely populated urban areas.

Moreover, a broader cultural shift in the United States is contributing to a decline in car ownership and usage. Studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and obtaining fewer licenses, indicating a potential peak in driving habits. Factors such as the rise of telecommuting facilitated by the internet, renewed interest in city living, and advancements in shared transportation contribute to this shift. If this pattern continues, it could lead to positive outcomes, including reduced carbon emissions and environmental impact.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are evident in environmental sustainability, reduced traffic congestion, and cultural shifts favoring alternative modes of transportation. From car-free suburbs in Germany to driving bans in Paris and car-free days in Bogota, the global movement toward smart planning and reduced car dependency holds promise for a more sustainable and livable future. As citizens, we should consider embracing these changes to foster a healthier and more environmentally conscious way of life.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

EXAMPLE 1:
All across the globe, a revolutionary idea is being set in motion. The idea of essentially banning cars from the streets has sparked as much interest as it has critics. The automotive industry has been booming since World War 2, and although the positive effects of cars can be seen in our daily lives, we seldom take into consideration of the negative impacts of cars. Effects such as pollution, traffic, and cost have impacted our lives as automotive users, even if we have not realized it.

Pollution is one of the primary concerns of a world that is constantly driving, yet it is something people hardly take into account when driving. In theory that is understandable, considering the last thing a person is thinking about when they're driving is what their car is spitting out into the atmosphere. However pollution doesn't go unnoticed for long. For example, the city of Paris, France enforced a partial driving ban in order to decrease the almost record breaking pollution across the city, stating, "The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world." The smog did clear from the city and previous driving laws were reinstated, however this shows how car pollution has a negative impact on the world around us.

Another negative impact of driving is traffic. Traffic is a driver's worst nightmare, and it affects all of us at some point in our lives. In Bogota, Columbia, citizens participated in a drivingfree day, where everyone was encouraged to either hike, bike, skate, or use public transportation in order to reach their destination. This event, in which millions of Colombians participated, was reportedly "leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams." This program left a positive mark on the city of Bogota, and will hopefully soon spread to other countries, reducing crowded, traffic filled streets around the world.

The world runs on money, just ask any Wall Street broker. This is a paradox concerning both car owners and people looking to purchase a car. The question remains, if we're all trying to save money, why spend thousands of dollars on a costly car? According to a census taken in 2013, "Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cashstrapped Americans could not afford cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway." This shows that the number of people buying cars is steadily decreasing. Another costly problem of cars is fuel. Buying gasoline for your car every week can get incredibly costly, especially when driving a large truck or sports car. This shows how the cost of cars can have a negative impact on our lives.

In conclusion, the use of cars is steadily declining. Cars just aren't a very positive motive for transportation anymore considering the effects of pollution, traffic, and cost that cars produce.

EXAMPLE 2:
Millions of people use cars in their everyday lives whether its driving to work, school or even the supermarket. With the amount of people on the streets on a daily basis, its not surprising that there is a major traffic issue in Miami. Most people dont realise how big of an issue this truly is because in reality they just need to get to and from work. I'm here to inform you about the beneficial alternatives to driving everywhere you go.

Whether going to work or driving your kids to soccer practice, a way of transportation is a must. Most people choose the "easy" way out and just hop in their brand new luxury cars. But what if I told you there is an easier way, a more efficient way? All around Miami, there are metro rail stations. These stations are clean, safe, and not to mention useful. There are busses, troll's, and even metro movers that can take you all around the city. the trains, busses, troll's and metro movers all run on a schedule. An easy way to limit your gas bill, pollution and time wasted in traffic is to simply set up a route to where you need to go and catch the appropriate mose of transportation.

Time is always on peoples mind, whether you have enough time to go shopping for a new dress or maybe stop by grandmas house. all things require time. Everyday millions of Americans spend hours stuck in traffic due to rushhour. This means less time spent with family anymore time bonding with the annoying car horns constantly beeping. If you could switch to another mode of transportation you could cut time commuting in half. The Metro rail avoided all traffic regardless and if more people start thinking like this then the bus might soon be avoidingall traffic too. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two says "When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way." Everyday she walks verdant streets listening to the delightful sound of people chatting and children playing, something she was unable to appreciate with her windows rolled up as she drove around town.

So many fuel consuming vehicles on the street on a daily basis can't be too great for our environment, don't you think? It isnt, all this pollution is causing a nasty smog all over the world, some places more than others. Paris tends to have more smog than Europe but not too long ago, Paris had 147 micrograms or particulate matter per cubic meter compared to 114 in Brussels. This smog makes it difficult for dilivery companies to complete their jobs. This smog isnt good for us either just think about what you are breathing.

In recent years, a groundbreaking idea has taken root across the globe—limiting the use of cars as a means of transportation. While cars have undoubtedly shaped our daily lives, their negative impacts on pollution, traffic, and personal finances are prompting a shift in perspective. As a high school student in the United States, it is essential to recognize the advantages of reducing car usage, drawing inspiration from examples worldwide.

One compelling instance of reimagining suburban life without cars is found in Vauban, Germany. In this experimental community, residents have voluntarily given up car ownership, with strict regulations on parking. The result is a community where 70 percent of families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their cars to embrace this lifestyle. This deliberate choice has led to improved well-being, as one resident notes, "When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." Vauban serves as a beacon for smart planning initiatives worldwide, illustrating the potential benefits of separating suburban life from excessive car use.

The detrimental impact of cars on the environment is another critical aspect to consider. The partial driving ban implemented in Paris due to smog highlights the urgency of addressing air pollution caused by automobiles. The ban, which led to a 60 percent reduction in congestion, demonstrates the immediate positive effects of limiting car usage on air quality. The growing awareness of the environmental toll of cars is driving initiatives like car-free days, such as the one in Bogota, Colombia, where millions participated, leaving the streets devoid of traffic jams and contributing to reduced smog.

Moreover, the evolving cultural shift in the United States, where people are buying fewer cars and driving less, aligns with broader efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions. President Obama's ambitious goals to reduce emissions align with the changing behavior of Americans who are increasingly opting for alternative transportation modes. The decrease in car ownership, particularly among the younger generation, reflects a transformative shift in attitudes toward personal vehicle ownership, with potential long-term benefits for carbon emissions and the environment.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are evident on multiple fronts, from improving overall well-being in communities like Vauban to addressing environmental concerns such as air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. As the world grapples with the consequences of excessive car use, adopting alternative transportation methods and embracing smart planning principles can pave the way for a more sustainable and vibrant future.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

EXAMPLE 1:
All across the globe, a revolutionary idea is being set in motion. The idea of essentially banning cars from the streets has sparked as much interest as it has critics. The automotive industry has been booming since World War 2, and although the positive effects of cars can be seen in our daily lives, we seldom take into consideration of the negative impacts of cars. Effects such as pollution, traffic, and cost have impacted our lives as automotive users, even if we have not realized it.

Pollution is one of the primary concerns of a world that is constantly driving, yet it is something people hardly take into account when driving. In theory that is understandable, considering the last thing a person is thinking about when they're driving is what their car is spitting out into the atmosphere. However pollution doesn't go unnoticed for long. For example, the city of Paris, France enforced a partial driving ban in order to decrease the almost record breaking pollution across the city, stating, "The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world." The smog did clear from the city and previous driving laws were reinstated, however this shows how car pollution has a negative impact on the world around us.

Another negative impact of driving is traffic. Traffic is a driver's worst nightmare, and it affects all of us at some point in our lives. In Bogota, Columbia, citizens participated in a drivingfree day, where everyone was encouraged to either hike, bike, skate, or use public transportation in order to reach their destination. This event, in which millions of Colombians participated, was reportedly "leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams." This program left a positive mark on the city of Bogota, and will hopefully soon spread to other countries, reducing crowded, traffic filled streets around the world.

The world runs on money, just ask any Wall Street broker. This is a paradox concerning both car owners and people looking to purchase a car. The question remains, if we're all trying to save money, why spend thousands of dollars on a costly car? According to a census taken in 2013, "Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cashstrapped Americans could not afford cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway." This shows that the number of people buying cars is steadily decreasing. Another costly problem of cars is fuel. Buying gasoline for your car every week can get incredibly costly, especially when driving a large truck or sports car. This shows how the cost of cars can have a negative impact on our lives.

In conclusion, the use of cars is steadily declining. Cars just aren't a very positive motive for transportation anymore considering the effects of pollution, traffic, and cost that cars produce.

EXAMPLE 2:
Millions of people use cars in their everyday lives whether its driving to work, school or even the supermarket. With the amount of people on the streets on a daily basis, its not surprising that there is a major traffic issue in Miami. Most people dont realise how big of an issue this truly is because in reality they just need to get to and from work. I'm here to inform you about the beneficial alternatives to driving everywhere you go.

Whether going to work or driving your kids to soccer practice, a way of transportation is a must. Most people choose the "easy" way out and just hop in their brand new luxury cars. But what if I told you there is an easier way, a more efficient way? All around Miami, there are metro rail stations. These stations are clean, safe, and not to mention useful. There are busses, troll's, and even metro movers that can take you all around the city. the trains, busses, troll's and metro movers all run on a schedule. An easy way to limit your gas bill, pollution and time wasted in traffic is to simply set up a route to where you need to go and catch the appropriate mose of transportation.

Time is always on peoples mind, whether you have enough time to go shopping for a new dress or maybe stop by grandmas house. all things require time. Everyday millions of Americans spend hours stuck in traffic due to rushhour. This means less time spent with family anymore time bonding with the annoying car horns constantly beeping. If you could switch to another mode of transportation you could cut time commuting in half. The Metro rail avoided all traffic regardless and if more people start thinking like this then the bus might soon be avoidingall traffic too. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two says "When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way." Everyday she walks verdant streets listening to the delightful sound of people chatting and children playing, something she was unable to appreciate with her windows rolled up as she drove around town.

So many fuel consuming vehicles on the street on a daily basis can't be too great for our environment, don't you think? It isnt, all this pollution is causing a nasty smog all over the world, some places more than others. Paris tends to have more smog than Europe but not too long ago, Paris had 147 micrograms or particulate matter per cubic meter compared to 114 in Brussels. This smog makes it difficult for dilivery companies to complete their jobs. This smog isnt good for us either just think about what you are breathing.

In today's fast-paced world, the automobile has become an indispensable part of our daily lives, offering convenience and mobility. However, recent trends around the globe suggest that limiting car usage might be the key to addressing pressing issues such as pollution, traffic congestion, and economic strain. By examining examples from Germany, France, Colombia, and the United States, it becomes evident that embracing alternative transportation methods and reducing dependence on cars can lead to a multitude of advantages.

One of the most significant advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact on environmental sustainability. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal's article on the German suburb Vauban, which experimented with a car-free community, residents experienced a notable reduction in stress and increased happiness when cars were excluded from daily life. Furthermore, the environmental benefits were tangible, with 70 percent of Vauban's families choosing not to own cars, contributing to a substantial decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. Rosenthal emphasizes that cars are responsible for a considerable portion of emissions in Europe and the United States, making them a critical focus for environmental initiatives.

In Paris, another example of the environmental consequences of excessive car usage is highlighted. Robert Duffer's article discusses how Paris enforced a partial driving ban to combat near-record pollution levels. The ban not only led to a significant decrease in congestion but also prompted citizens to explore alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit. The event underscores the potential for positive change when cities prioritize environmental concerns over unrestricted car usage.

Apart from environmental benefits, limiting car usage has proven to alleviate traffic congestion, which is a common woe in bustling cities. The car-free day initiative in Bogota, Colombia, as reported by Andrew Selsky, showcased a city without the usual traffic jams, providing a stark contrast to the congested norm. Millions of Colombians embraced alternative transportation methods, such as hiking, biking, skating, or using public buses, leading to a 60 percent reduction in congestion. This initiative demonstrates the feasibility of reducing traffic-related stress and enhancing overall urban mobility by encouraging citizens to explore alternative modes of transport.

Economic considerations also play a crucial role in advocating for the limitation of car usage. Elisabeth Rosenthal's analysis of President Obama's goals to curb greenhouse gas emissions highlights a cultural shift in the United States, with studies indicating a decline in car ownership and driving. The decreasing interest in car ownership among young adults, as mentioned in Rosenthal's piece, suggests a trend that could have long-term economic implications for the automotive industry. As people explore alternatives like public transit, car-sharing programs, and biking, the need for personal vehicle ownership diminishes, potentially leading to a shift in business models within the automotive industry.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are multifaceted and extend beyond individual preferences. From environmental sustainability and reduced traffic congestion to economic considerations, the global shift toward embracing alternative transportation methods is evident. As exemplified by innovative communities and cities around the world, smart planning that prioritizes public transportation and minimizes dependence on cars can lead to a more sustainable and harmonious future for urban life.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

EXAMPLE 1:
Cars are a luxury, but others take them for granted. Many people around the world operate cars every single day! Very few people around the world do not own a car, or have never operated one. In Vauban, Germany, residents of an upscale, high class community have decided to give up on cars. vaughn's streets are entirely "carfree" except the in the city where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Don't get Germany wrong, you are allowed to own a car, but there's very few places to park the car you own. The only placed you can park are large garages at the end of your neighborhood or development, but parking isn't free here. You must buy a space for 40,000, along with the price of your home. 70 percent of vaughn's citizens do not own cars, and 57 percent alone sold their car to move there. "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way," said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and a mother of two. Vauban, Germany completed in 2006, is an excellent example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States, and other places to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called "smart planning." According to Elisabeth Rosenthal who wrote, "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars." Cars can either be a blessing or a mistake. Cars can tend to put out polluting gases, and endanger our earth. In Paris, all driving was banned due to smog. On a Monday, motorisits with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 31 fine. The same would apply to the oddnumbered plates the following day. The car emissions were trapped by a warmer layer of air, because of cold nights and warm days. Congestion in Paris, France wa down 60 percent after just fivedays of intensifying snog. This caused the smog to rival Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. That's pretty bad to be competing with China. The Monday where all cars were banned, the smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates the following day.

Now, what about a car free day? In Bogota, Colombia, there was a car free day. Every citizen either had to hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work during this carfree day. This car free day caused the city to not have any traffic jams, and no accidents at all. This isn't just the first year that Colombia decided to do this, but it was the third! This day is specifically called, "Day Without Cars." 7 million citizens were expected to find a different way to go to the destinations they needed to reach, without their trusty cars. Bogota receives a vast amount of rain storms each day, but the turnout was still at large. "The rain hasn't stopped people from participating," said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus. Many citizens of Bogota said that this day takes away not only their stress, but also a ton of pollution. "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution," said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he and his wife rode a twoseat bicycle.

Almost every single citizen in the United States of America owns or drives a car every single day. This has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed the peak of driving? The United States is known for its broad expanses and suburban ideals, and has long been known for one of the world's prime car cultures. It is indeed the birthplace of Model T the home of Detroit the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized "Mustang Sally." Lately America's love addiction with motor vehicles seems to be settling down. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 8 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Most of the explanation to this certainly comes from recession, because broke Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. "What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn," said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute. "I think that means something more fundamental is going on," he also said. All of these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession need to find reasons NOT to resume the habit of driving and spending stupid amounts of money on gasoline. The state of New York has a new bikesharing programs and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls refelct those new priorities, as do a proliferation of carsharing programs across the nation. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.

Many people around the world have cut driving out of their life for many reasons. Some being safety, money, and pollution.

Example 2:
Nearly everyone in the United States has a car, if they're of age. Many people would probably argue that they need cars. How else would you get somewhere? Well, there are plenty of alternatives to driving, and other ways to just cut back. Limiting car usage has become rather popular recently. Even though there are some disadvantages from limiting car usage, there are so many more advantages that are extremely beneficial.

Pollution has always been a big problem almost everywhere in the world, and cars have a huge influence on it. Pollution can affect people's health and damages the environment. In Paris they put up a partial driving ban to clear up horrible smog. "Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog..." Source 2. It only took one day of a driving ban to clear up the smog. Imagine how much less pollution there would be if people limited driving for multiple days, even maybe weeks, or months? It's not like you have to permanently give up driving, just limit it when you can.

Limiting car usage can also help reduce stress levels and make you happier. It might sound crazy at first because, well how would you get places? Wouldn't that cause more stress? Vauban, a city in Germany, is a city that "forbids" parking, driveways, and houses with garages. They strategically put stores and buildings within an idealistic walking distance. "when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two" Source 1. If a working mother can do it, so can you. When you're always inside and juggling your kids and their needs, you'll most likely be tense and always feel busy. When you have no other option, besides paying over fourty grand for a space in a parking garage, than to walk somewhere, you'll get to be outside and experience socialization and the fresh air. In my opinion that sounds way better than being confined to a little car when you have to go somewhere.

Obviously there are uncountable benefits that come from limiting car usage. I don't know about you, but honestly I would prefer limited car usage. Until someone takes action to start making it easier to access places we would normally need our car to get to, limiting car usage is not going to be easy.

Limiting car usage has become a topic of discussion and experimentation in various parts of the world, driven by the recognition of the advantages associated with reduced reliance on automobiles. One prominent example is Vauban, Germany, where an innovative community has taken the bold step of giving up cars altogether. Streets in Vauban are "car-free," except for the main thoroughfare where a tram to downtown Freiburg runs and a few streets on one edge of the community. Residents are allowed to own cars, but parking is restricted to large garages at the edge of the development, priced at $40,000 per space. This approach has resulted in 70 percent of Vauban's families not owning cars, and 57 percent selling a car to move to this unique community.

Vauban, completed in 2006, represents a growing trend in Europe, the United States, and beyond to separate suburban life from auto use as part of a movement known as "smart planning." Traditional suburban development, centered around car dependence, has been identified as a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars alone are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. The need for change is evident, and experts argue that reducing car usage is a crucial component of efforts to address climate change.

Beyond environmental concerns, limiting car usage has shown positive effects on individual well-being. Residents of Vauban attest to feeling happier and less tense without the constant reliance on cars. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two in Vauban, expressed, "When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." This sentiment is echoed in other communities around the world that have adopted similar measures to promote a shift away from car-centric lifestyles.

Paris, facing severe smog issues, implemented a partial driving ban with even- and odd-numbered license plates on alternate days. The ban resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion and demonstrated the potential impact of temporary measures to limit car usage. Additionally, Bogota, Colombia, has successfully organized a "Day Without Cars" for three consecutive years, where millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work, leaving the streets traffic-free and promoting alternative transportation methods.

In the United States, there is a noticeable shift in driving behavior, with recent studies suggesting a decline in car ownership and driving. This trend aligns with President Obama's goals to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The decrease in driving is attributed not only to the economic downturn but also to a fundamental shift in behavior, with factors such as the rise of the internet enabling telecommuting, renewed interest in city living, and the availability of alternative transportation options.

While the idea of limiting car usage may face initial resistance, the long-term benefits are evident. Reduced pollution, improved mental well-being, and a positive impact on climate change are compelling reasons to consider alternative modes of transportation. As communities worldwide explore and implement "smart planning" strategies, the hope is that a cultural shift away from excessive car usage will become more widespread, leading to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly future.

Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

EXAMPLE 1:
Cars are a luxury, but others take them for granted. Many people around the world operate cars every single day! Very few people around the world do not own a car, or have never operated one. In Vauban, Germany, residents of an upscale, high class community have decided to give up on cars. vaughn's streets are entirely "carfree" except the in the city where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Don't get Germany wrong, you are allowed to own a car, but there's very few places to park the car you own. The only placed you can park are large garages at the end of your neighborhood or development, but parking isn't free here. You must buy a space for 40,000, along with the price of your home. 70 percent of vaughn's citizens do not own cars, and 57 percent alone sold their car to move there. "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way," said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and a mother of two. Vauban, Germany completed in 2006, is an excellent example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States, and other places to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called "smart planning." According to Elisabeth Rosenthal who wrote, "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars." Cars can either be a blessing or a mistake. Cars can tend to put out polluting gases, and endanger our earth. In Paris, all driving was banned due to smog. On a Monday, motorisits with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 31 fine. The same would apply to the oddnumbered plates the following day. The car emissions were trapped by a warmer layer of air, because of cold nights and warm days. Congestion in Paris, France wa down 60 percent after just fivedays of intensifying snog. This caused the smog to rival Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. That's pretty bad to be competing with China. The Monday where all cars were banned, the smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates the following day.

Now, what about a car free day? In Bogota, Colombia, there was a car free day. Every citizen either had to hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work during this carfree day. This car free day caused the city to not have any traffic jams, and no accidents at all. This isn't just the first year that Colombia decided to do this, but it was the third! This day is specifically called, "Day Without Cars." 7 million citizens were expected to find a different way to go to the destinations they needed to reach, without their trusty cars. Bogota receives a vast amount of rain storms each day, but the turnout was still at large. "The rain hasn't stopped people from participating," said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus. Many citizens of Bogota said that this day takes away not only their stress, but also a ton of pollution. "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution," said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he and his wife rode a twoseat bicycle.

Almost every single citizen in the United States of America owns or drives a car every single day. This has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed the peak of driving? The United States is known for its broad expanses and suburban ideals, and has long been known for one of the world's prime car cultures. It is indeed the birthplace of Model T the home of Detroit the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized "Mustang Sally." Lately America's love addiction with motor vehicles seems to be settling down. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 8 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Most of the explanation to this certainly comes from recession, because broke Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. "What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn," said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute. "I think that means something more fundamental is going on," he also said. All of these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession need to find reasons NOT to resume the habit of driving and spending stupid amounts of money on gasoline. The state of New York has a new bikesharing programs and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls refelct those new priorities, as do a proliferation of carsharing programs across the nation. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.

Many people around the world have cut driving out of their life for many reasons. Some being safety, money, and pollution.

Example 2:
Nearly everyone in the United States has a car, if they're of age. Many people would probably argue that they need cars. How else would you get somewhere? Well, there are plenty of alternatives to driving, and other ways to just cut back. Limiting car usage has become rather popular recently. Even though there are some disadvantages from limiting car usage, there are so many more advantages that are extremely beneficial.

Pollution has always been a big problem almost everywhere in the world, and cars have a huge influence on it. Pollution can affect people's health and damages the environment. In Paris they put up a partial driving ban to clear up horrible smog. "Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog..." Source 2. It only took one day of a driving ban to clear up the smog. Imagine how much less pollution there would be if people limited driving for multiple days, even maybe weeks, or months? It's not like you have to permanently give up driving, just limit it when you can.

Limiting car usage can also help reduce stress levels and make you happier. It might sound crazy at first because, well how would you get places? Wouldn't that cause more stress? Vauban, a city in Germany, is a city that "forbids" parking, driveways, and houses with garages. They strategically put stores and buildings within an idealistic walking distance. "when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two" Source 1. If a working mother can do it, so can you. When you're always inside and juggling your kids and their needs, you'll most likely be tense and always feel busy. When you have no other option, besides paying over fourty grand for a space in a parking garage, than to walk somewhere, you'll get to be outside and experience socialization and the fresh air. In my opinion that sounds way better than being confined to a little car when you have to go somewhere.

Obviously there are uncountable benefits that come from limiting car usage. I don't know about you, but honestly I would prefer limited car usage. Until someone takes action to start making it easier to access places we would normally need our car to get to, limiting car usage is not going to be easy.

Limiting car usage presents numerous advantages that extend beyond personal convenience and preferences. As exemplified by Vauban, Germany, and other instances worldwide, this shift away from excessive car reliance contributes to environmental sustainability, public health, and community well-being.

Vauban, Germany, stands as a pioneering example of a community that has embraced a lifestyle free from the constraints of car ownership. The deliberate design of the neighborhood, with restricted parking and an emphasis on public transportation, has led to 70 percent of families forgoing car ownership altogether. This not only reflects a commitment to "smart planning" but also addresses the environmental impact of cars. In Europe, where passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, Vauban's model emerges as a progressive step toward reducing carbon footprints.

The initiative to limit car usage is not exclusive to Vauban; Paris, in response to severe smog conditions, implemented a temporary driving ban. The results were evident, with a 60 percent reduction in congestion and an improvement in air quality. Such measures demonstrate the immediate positive effects on public health and environmental conditions when car usage is restricted.

Bogota, Colombia, took the concept a step further with its annual "Day Without Cars." This event, now in its third year, encourages millions to explore alternative transportation methods, promoting a healthier lifestyle and reducing pollution. Despite occasional rain showers, the turnout remained substantial, reflecting a growing awareness of the benefits of limiting car usage.

In the United States, a cultural shift is occurring, marked by a decline in car ownership and driving. Researchers suggest that the country may have reached "peak driving," with the number of miles driven per person steadily decreasing. This shift is not solely attributed to economic factors but also indicates a fundamental change in societal attitudes towards car ownership. Initiatives such as New York's bike-sharing program and the proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation underscore this trend.

Reducing car usage has broader implications, not only for individuals but for entire communities and the planet. The decrease in driving aligns with environmental goals, as transportation is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, it fosters a sense of community by promoting alternative transportation methods and creating spaces where people can interact without the barrier of cars.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers a multifaceted solution to environmental, health, and community-related challenges. By adopting innovative urban planning, temporary driving bans, and initiatives like "Day Without Cars," societies can pave the way for a more sustainable and interconnected future. As the world grapples with the consequences of excessive car usage, these examples serve as beacons of hope, illustrating the positive impact that conscious decisions regarding transportation can have on the well-being of individuals and the planet.

EXAMPLE 1:
Cars are a luxury, but others take them for granted. Many people around the world operate cars every single day! Very few people around the world do not own a car, or have never operated one. In Vauban, Germany, residents of an upscale, high class community have decided to give up on cars. vaughn's streets are entirely "carfree" except the in the city where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Don't get Germany wrong, you are allowed to own a car, but there's very few places to park the car you own. The only placed you can park are large garages at the end of your neighborhood or development, but parking isn't free here. You must buy a space for 40,000, along with the price of your home. 70 percent of vaughn's citizens do not own cars, and 57 percent alone sold their car to move there. "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way," said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and a mother of two. Vauban, Germany completed in 2006, is an excellent example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States, and other places to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called "smart planning." According to Elisabeth Rosenthal who wrote, "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars." Cars can either be a blessing or a mistake. Cars can tend to put out polluting gases, and endanger our earth. In Paris, all driving was banned due to smog. On a Monday, motorisits with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 31 fine. The same would apply to the oddnumbered plates the following day. The car emissions were trapped by a warmer layer of air, because of cold nights and warm days. Congestion in Paris, France wa down 60 percent after just fivedays of intensifying snog. This caused the smog to rival Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. That's pretty bad to be competing with China. The Monday where all cars were banned, the smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates the following day.

Now, what about a car free day? In Bogota, Colombia, there was a car free day. Every citizen either had to hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work during this carfree day. This car free day caused the city to not have any traffic jams, and no accidents at all. This isn't just the first year that Colombia decided to do this, but it was the third! This day is specifically called, "Day Without Cars." 7 million citizens were expected to find a different way to go to the destinations they needed to reach, without their trusty cars. Bogota receives a vast amount of rain storms each day, but the turnout was still at large. "The rain hasn't stopped people from participating," said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus. Many citizens of Bogota said that this day takes away not only their stress, but also a ton of pollution. "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution," said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he and his wife rode a twoseat bicycle.

Almost every single citizen in the United States of America owns or drives a car every single day. This has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed the peak of driving? The United States is known for its broad expanses and suburban ideals, and has long been known for one of the world's prime car cultures. It is indeed the birthplace of Model T the home of Detroit the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized "Mustang Sally." Lately America's love addiction with motor vehicles seems to be settling down. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 8 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Most of the explanation to this certainly comes from recession, because broke Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. "What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn," said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute. "I think that means something more fundamental is going on," he also said. All of these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession need to find reasons NOT to resume the habit of driving and spending stupid amounts of money on gasoline. The state of New York has a new bikesharing programs and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls refelct those new priorities, as do a proliferation of carsharing programs across the nation. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.

Many people around the world have cut driving out of their life for many reasons. Some being safety, money, and pollution.

Example 2:
Nearly everyone in the United States has a car, if they're of age. Many people would probably argue that they need cars. How else would you get somewhere? Well, there are plenty of alternatives to driving, and other ways to just cut back. Limiting car usage has become rather popular recently. Even though there are some disadvantages from limiting car usage, there are so many more advantages that are extremely beneficial.

Pollution has always been a big problem almost everywhere in the world, and cars have a huge influence on it. Pollution can affect people's health and damages the environment. In Paris they put up a partial driving ban to clear up horrible smog. "Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog..." Source 2. It only took one day of a driving ban to clear up the smog. Imagine how much less pollution there would be if people limited driving for multiple days, even maybe weeks, or months? It's not like you have to permanently give up driving, just limit it when you can.

Limiting car usage can also help reduce stress levels and make you happier. It might sound crazy at first because, well how would you get places? Wouldn't that cause more stress? Vauban, a city in Germany, is a city that "forbids" parking, driveways, and houses with garages. They strategically put stores and buildings within an idealistic walking distance. "when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two" Source 1. If a working mother can do it, so can you. When you're always inside and juggling your kids and their needs, you'll most likely be tense and always feel busy. When you have no other option, besides paying over fourty grand for a space in a parking garage, than to walk somewhere, you'll get to be outside and experience socialization and the fresh air. In my opinion that sounds way better than being confined to a little car when you have to go somewhere.

Obviously there are uncountable benefits that come from limiting car usage. I don't know about you, but honestly I would prefer limited car usage. Until someone takes action to start making it easier to access places we would normally need our car to get to, limiting car usage is not going to be easy.

In recent years, a growing trend around the world has emerged, advocating for the limitation of car usage. This movement, often associated with "smart planning," seeks to reshape suburban life by reducing dependence on automobiles. Vauban, an upscale community in Germany, stands out as a pioneer in this regard, where residents have voluntarily given up their cars. Streets in Vauban are deliberately designed to be "car-free," allowing only limited parking spaces at the edge of the development, emphasizing a shift towards a more sustainable and environmentally friendly lifestyle.

One compelling advantage of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to experts, passenger cars contribute to 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By adopting practices similar to Vauban's, other communities aim to break away from the traditional suburban model centered around cars. This movement challenges the status quo, suggesting that the amount people drive is as crucial as the type of vehicles they own, as articulated by David Goldberg of Transportation for America.

Paris provides another striking example of the environmental impact of cars. In response to near-record pollution levels, the city enforced a partial driving ban, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion. The ban effectively curbed smog, even rivalling the pollution levels of notoriously polluted cities like Beijing. Such measures demonstrate the potential positive outcomes of restricting car usage in major urban centers, not only for the environment but also for public health.

Beyond environmental benefits, limiting car usage can enhance the overall well-being of individuals. In Vauban, residents reported decreased stress levels after giving up their cars. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, expressed her contentment, stating, "When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." This sentiment suggests that alternative modes of transportation, such as walking and cycling, can contribute to a healthier and more relaxed lifestyle.

Car-free initiatives, like the annual "Day Without Cars" in Bogota, Colombia, further illustrate the potential for positive change. Millions of Colombians participated in this event, promoting alternative transportation methods and leaving the streets eerily devoid of traffic jams. The success of such initiatives demonstrates that, with proper planning and commitment, communities can thrive without relying heavily on cars.

In the United States, where car culture has long been ingrained, a shift in behavior is becoming evident. Recent studies suggest a decline in car ownership, driving, and licensing, prompting questions about whether the country has reached "peak driving." This shift, influenced by factors such as economic considerations, technological advancements, and changing social preferences, aligns with President Obama's goals to curb greenhouse gas emissions.

While limiting car usage poses some challenges, including the need for improved public transportation infrastructure, changing cultural norms, and addressing accessibility concerns, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. As societies increasingly recognize the importance of sustainable living, smart planning, and reduced environmental impact, the trend towards limiting car usage is likely to gain momentum and reshape the way we approach transportation and suburban life.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

In recent years, a significant shift in urban planning and lifestyle choices has emerged, advocating for the advantages of limiting car usage. This movement, often referred to as "smart planning," aims to reshape suburban life, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and create more sustainable communities. Examining examples from Germany, France, Colombia, and the United States, it becomes evident that the benefits of restricting car usage extend beyond environmental concerns to encompass improved well-being, reduced stress, and enhanced urban livability.

In the upscale community of Vauban, Germany, residents have pioneered a car-free lifestyle, with streets designed to be completely devoid of cars, except for a main thoroughfare for public transportation. The experiment, part of the "smart planning" movement, has led to 70 percent of families in Vauban not owning cars, and 57 percent selling their cars to move there. Residents, such as media trainer Heidrun Walter, have reported increased happiness and reduced tension, emphasizing the positive impact of limiting car usage on personal well-being.

France's response to smog-induced pollution in Paris provides another compelling example of the advantages of restricting car usage. A partial driving ban, enforced based on license plate numbers, resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion and a notable improvement in air quality. The ban, albeit temporary, showcased the immediate positive effects of limiting car usage in mitigating environmental challenges.

Beyond Europe, Bogota, Colombia, has successfully implemented an annual "Day Without Cars." During this event, millions of citizens hike, bike, skate, or use public transportation instead of cars. The car-free day not only reduces traffic congestion but also promotes alternative transportation methods, contributing to lower stress levels and decreased air pollution. The success of this program has inspired other cities to consider similar initiatives.

In the United States, a cultural shift away from excessive car usage is becoming apparent. Studies indicate a decrease in the number of miles driven per person, challenging the notion of America as a car-centric society. This shift is attributed to factors such as the rise of telecommuting, increased connectivity through the internet, and a renewed interest in urban living. As young people show decreasing interest in obtaining driver's licenses and prioritize alternative transportation, the landscape of American mobility is evolving.

While limiting car usage poses challenges, such as adapting infrastructure and transportation systems, the benefits are substantial. Reduced environmental impact, improved personal well-being, and the creation of more vibrant and accessible communities are among the positive outcomes. As the world grapples with the need for sustainable living, the examples of Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and the changing trends in the United States underscore the advantages of embracing a lifestyle with less dependence on cars. Through careful planning and a collective shift in mindset, limiting car usage can contribute to a healthier, more sustainable future for communities worldwide.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

39 He and I have similar observations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver’s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

EXAMPLE 1:
Cars are a luxury, but others take them for granted. Many people around the world operate cars every single day! Very few people around the world do not own a car, or have never operated one. In Vauban, Germany, residents of an upscale, high class community have decided to give up on cars. vaughn's streets are entirely "carfree" except the in the city where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Don't get Germany wrong, you are allowed to own a car, but there's very few places to park the car you own. The only placed you can park are large garages at the end of your neighborhood or development, but parking isn't free here. You must buy a space for 40,000, along with the price of your home. 70 percent of vaughn's citizens do not own cars, and 57 percent alone sold their car to move there. "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way," said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and a mother of two. Vauban, Germany completed in 2006, is an excellent example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States, and other places to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called "smart planning." According to Elisabeth Rosenthal who wrote, "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars." Cars can either be a blessing or a mistake. Cars can tend to put out polluting gases, and endanger our earth. In Paris, all driving was banned due to smog. On a Monday, motorisits with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 31 fine. The same would apply to the oddnumbered plates the following day. The car emissions were trapped by a warmer layer of air, because of cold nights and warm days. Congestion in Paris, France wa down 60 percent after just fivedays of intensifying snog. This caused the smog to rival Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. That's pretty bad to be competing with China. The Monday where all cars were banned, the smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates the following day.

Now, what about a car free day? In Bogota, Colombia, there was a car free day. Every citizen either had to hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work during this carfree day. This car free day caused the city to not have any traffic jams, and no accidents at all. This isn't just the first year that Colombia decided to do this, but it was the third! This day is specifically called, "Day Without Cars." 7 million citizens were expected to find a different way to go to the destinations they needed to reach, without their trusty cars. Bogota receives a vast amount of rain storms each day, but the turnout was still at large. "The rain hasn't stopped people from participating," said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus. Many citizens of Bogota said that this day takes away not only their stress, but also a ton of pollution. "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution," said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he and his wife rode a twoseat bicycle.

Almost every single citizen in the United States of America owns or drives a car every single day. This has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed the peak of driving? The United States is known for its broad expanses and suburban ideals, and has long been known for one of the world's prime car cultures. It is indeed the birthplace of Model T the home of Detroit the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized "Mustang Sally." Lately America's love addiction with motor vehicles seems to be settling down. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 8 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Most of the explanation to this certainly comes from recession, because broke Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. "What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn," said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute. "I think that means something more fundamental is going on," he also said. All of these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession need to find reasons NOT to resume the habit of driving and spending stupid amounts of money on gasoline. The state of New York has a new bikesharing programs and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls refelct those new priorities, as do a proliferation of carsharing programs across the nation. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.

Many people around the world have cut driving out of their life for many reasons. Some being safety, money, and pollution.

Example 2:
Nearly everyone in the United States has a car, if they're of age. Many people would probably argue that they need cars. How else would you get somewhere? Well, there are plenty of alternatives to driving, and other ways to just cut back. Limiting car usage has become rather popular recently. Even though there are some disadvantages from limiting car usage, there are so many more advantages that are extremely beneficial.

Pollution has always been a big problem almost everywhere in the world, and cars have a huge influence on it. Pollution can affect people's health and damages the environment. In Paris they put up a partial driving ban to clear up horrible smog. "Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog..." Source 2. It only took one day of a driving ban to clear up the smog. Imagine how much less pollution there would be if people limited driving for multiple days, even maybe weeks, or months? It's not like you have to permanently give up driving, just limit it when you can.

Limiting car usage can also help reduce stress levels and make you happier. It might sound crazy at first because, well how would you get places? Wouldn't that cause more stress? Vauban, a city in Germany, is a city that "forbids" parking, driveways, and houses with garages. They strategically put stores and buildings within an idealistic walking distance. "when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two" Source 1. If a working mother can do it, so can you. When you're always inside and juggling your kids and their needs, you'll most likely be tense and always feel busy. When you have no other option, besides paying over fourty grand for a space in a parking garage, than to walk somewhere, you'll get to be outside and experience socialization and the fresh air. In my opinion that sounds way better than being confined to a little car when you have to go somewhere.

Obviously there are uncountable benefits that come from limiting car usage. I don't know about you, but honestly I would prefer limited car usage. Until someone takes action to start making it easier to access places we would normally need our car to get to, limiting car usage is not going to be easy.

Cars have become an indispensable part of daily life for many people around the world. The convenience they offer is hard to overlook, but recent initiatives in various parts of the globe suggest that limiting car usage can bring about significant advantages. This essay explores the benefits of reducing reliance on cars, drawing insights from several sources that highlight the experiences of communities in Germany, France, Colombia, and the United States.

One notable example is the German suburb of Vauban, where residents have taken a pioneering step by giving up their cars. In Vauban, streets are designed to be "car-free," and strict regulations on parking and garages discourage car ownership. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal's article, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their cars to move to this experimental community. The residents express increased satisfaction and happiness with this lifestyle, as emphasized by Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, who mentioned, "When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way" (Source 1).

The advantages of reducing car usage extend beyond individual well-being to environmental concerns. Cars are a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in suburban areas. As noted in the passage, automobiles account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Source 5). Efforts to limit car usage align with broader environmental goals, especially in the context of combating climate change.

Paris provides another compelling example of the positive impact of limiting car usage. In response to near-record pollution, the city enforced a partial driving ban, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion. The smog levels, comparable to Beijing's notorious pollution, significantly decreased after just five days of the driving ban (Source 10). This demonstrates the immediate environmental benefits that can be achieved through short-term restrictions on car usage.

Beyond Europe, Bogota, Colombia, has successfully implemented a car-free day for three consecutive years. Millions of Colombians participated in hiking, biking, skating, or taking buses to work, leaving the streets devoid of the typical traffic jams. The initiative aims to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog, contributing to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly urban environment (Source 21).

In the United States, there is a growing shift in behavior regarding car ownership and usage. Studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. The decrease in driving is attributed not only to economic factors, such as the recession, but also to fundamental shifts in cultural preferences and the availability of alternative transportation options. Initiatives like New York's bike-sharing program and the proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation reflect changing priorities and preferences among Americans (Source 29, 37).

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers a range of advantages, including environmental sustainability, reduced stress, and enhanced overall well-being. The experiences of communities in Germany, France, Colombia, and the United States highlight the positive outcomes associated with smart planning, environmental consciousness, and the promotion of alternative transportation. As the world grapples with the challenges of climate change and urbanization, embracing a lifestyle with reduced reliance on cars emerges as a viable and beneficial solution.

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

They are interested, but it’s not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.

40 Mr. Sivak’s son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving. “When I was in my 20s and 30s,” Mr. Sivak said, “I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don’t really care. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn’t work.”

41 A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. . . .

42 Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question. But such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright.

43 At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which “pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.”

EXAMPLE 1:
Cars are a luxury, but others take them for granted. Many people around the world operate cars every single day! Very few people around the world do not own a car, or have never operated one. In Vauban, Germany, residents of an upscale, high class community have decided to give up on cars. vaughn's streets are entirely "carfree" except the in the city where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Don't get Germany wrong, you are allowed to own a car, but there's very few places to park the car you own. The only placed you can park are large garages at the end of your neighborhood or development, but parking isn't free here. You must buy a space for 40,000, along with the price of your home. 70 percent of vaughn's citizens do not own cars, and 57 percent alone sold their car to move there. "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way," said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and a mother of two. Vauban, Germany completed in 2006, is an excellent example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States, and other places to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called "smart planning." According to Elisabeth Rosenthal who wrote, "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars." Cars can either be a blessing or a mistake. Cars can tend to put out polluting gases, and endanger our earth. In Paris, all driving was banned due to smog. On a Monday, motorisits with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 31 fine. The same would apply to the oddnumbered plates the following day. The car emissions were trapped by a warmer layer of air, because of cold nights and warm days. Congestion in Paris, France wa down 60 percent after just fivedays of intensifying snog. This caused the smog to rival Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. That's pretty bad to be competing with China. The Monday where all cars were banned, the smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates the following day.

Now, what about a car free day? In Bogota, Colombia, there was a car free day. Every citizen either had to hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work during this carfree day. This car free day caused the city to not have any traffic jams, and no accidents at all. This isn't just the first year that Colombia decided to do this, but it was the third! This day is specifically called, "Day Without Cars." 7 million citizens were expected to find a different way to go to the destinations they needed to reach, without their trusty cars. Bogota receives a vast amount of rain storms each day, but the turnout was still at large. "The rain hasn't stopped people from participating," said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus. Many citizens of Bogota said that this day takes away not only their stress, but also a ton of pollution. "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution," said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he and his wife rode a twoseat bicycle.

Almost every single citizen in the United States of America owns or drives a car every single day. This has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed the peak of driving? The United States is known for its broad expanses and suburban ideals, and has long been known for one of the world's prime car cultures. It is indeed the birthplace of Model T the home of Detroit the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized "Mustang Sally." Lately America's love addiction with motor vehicles seems to be settling down. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 8 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Most of the explanation to this certainly comes from recession, because broke Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. "What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn," said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute. "I think that means something more fundamental is going on," he also said. All of these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession need to find reasons NOT to resume the habit of driving and spending stupid amounts of money on gasoline. The state of New York has a new bikesharing programs and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls refelct those new priorities, as do a proliferation of carsharing programs across the nation. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.

Many people around the world have cut driving out of their life for many reasons. Some being safety, money, and pollution.

Example 2:
Nearly everyone in the United States has a car, if they're of age. Many people would probably argue that they need cars. How else would you get somewhere? Well, there are plenty of alternatives to driving, and other ways to just cut back. Limiting car usage has become rather popular recently. Even though there are some disadvantages from limiting car usage, there are so many more advantages that are extremely beneficial.

Pollution has always been a big problem almost everywhere in the world, and cars have a huge influence on it. Pollution can affect people's health and damages the environment. In Paris they put up a partial driving ban to clear up horrible smog. "Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog..." Source 2. It only took one day of a driving ban to clear up the smog. Imagine how much less pollution there would be if people limited driving for multiple days, even maybe weeks, or months? It's not like you have to permanently give up driving, just limit it when you can.

Limiting car usage can also help reduce stress levels and make you happier. It might sound crazy at first because, well how would you get places? Wouldn't that cause more stress? Vauban, a city in Germany, is a city that "forbids" parking, driveways, and houses with garages. They strategically put stores and buildings within an idealistic walking distance. "when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two" Source 1. If a working mother can do it, so can you. When you're always inside and juggling your kids and their needs, you'll most likely be tense and always feel busy. When you have no other option, besides paying over fourty grand for a space in a parking garage, than to walk somewhere, you'll get to be outside and experience socialization and the fresh air. In my opinion that sounds way better than being confined to a little car when you have to go somewhere.

Obviously there are uncountable benefits that come from limiting car usage. I don't know about you, but honestly I would prefer limited car usage. Until someone takes action to start making it easier to access places we would normally need our car to get to, limiting car usage is not going to be easy.

Limiting car usage can bring about numerous advantages that extend beyond individual convenience, affecting environmental, health, and societal aspects. In Vauban, Germany, a groundbreaking experiment in urban planning has resulted in a car-free community. This approach, known as "smart planning," is gaining traction globally as cities recognize the need to reduce the environmental impact of car-dependent suburbs. By restricting parking options and strategically placing essential services within walking distance, Vauban has successfully reduced car ownership, with 70 percent of families opting to live without cars. Residents report heightened happiness levels, attributing it to the reduced stress associated with car ownership.

The environmental benefits of limiting car usage are evident in Paris, where a partial driving ban was enforced to combat intense smog. The ban led to a 60 percent reduction in congestion, showcasing the potential for immediate improvements in air quality. This demonstrates the profound impact that even short-term restrictions on car usage can have on pollution levels, providing a compelling argument for adopting such measures more broadly.

Bogota, Colombia's "Day Without Cars" initiative further emphasizes the societal benefits of reducing car reliance. Millions of Colombians opted for alternative transportation on this day, resulting in eerily traffic-free streets and a significant reduction in stress for participants. This successful event, now in its third year, has even inspired other cities to explore similar initiatives, underlining the potential for a cultural shift away from car-centric habits.

In the United States, there are indications that the nation may be reaching a turning point in its car culture. Studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and obtaining fewer licenses, contributing to a decrease in the number of miles driven per person. This trend is not solely a consequence of economic factors but appears to be indicative of a fundamental shift in attitudes towards car ownership.

Reducing car usage has far-reaching implications, not just for individuals but for society as a whole. It addresses environmental concerns, promotes healthier and happier lifestyles, and contributes to a shift in cultural norms surrounding personal transportation. As communities worldwide grapple with the need for sustainability, limiting car usage emerges as a viable and necessary solution for the well-being of both individuals and the planet.

# In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal

1 VAUBAN, Germany—Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.

2 Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban’s streets are completely “car-free”—except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park—large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.

3 As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way,” said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

4 Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called “smart planning.”

5 Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes . . . . Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

6 While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs . . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

7 “All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,” said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States . . . who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg added: “How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.”

8 Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.

9 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting “car reduced” communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg said. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

# Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer

10 After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

11 On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.

12 Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters1 . . . [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

13 That’s easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees.2

14 Congestion 3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

15 Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

16 Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

17 Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

18 Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC.

19 The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. 1

# Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky

BOGOTA, Colombia—In a program that’s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

21 It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

22 The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota.

23 “The rain hasn’t stopped people from participating,” said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus . . . .

24 “It’s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,” said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

25 For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event.

26 Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. “These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,” said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. . . .

27 The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city’s mayor.

28 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

# The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal

29 President Obama’s ambitious goals to curb the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient1 shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

30 That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

31 The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world’s prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized “Mustang Sally” . . . .

32 But America’s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren’t going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. The next few years will be telling.

33 “What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,” said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute. “I think that means something more fundamental is going on.”

34 If the pattern persists—and many sociologists believe it will—it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America’s emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Indeed, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves “mobility” companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle.

35 “Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,” said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center. She cites various factors: the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work.

36 With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. . . .

37 New York’s new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.

38 Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak’s research has found.

In recent years, a compelling trend has emerged across the globe, challenging the conventional dependence on cars and advocating for the advantages of limiting car usage. From the car-free streets of Vauban, Germany, to the temporary driving bans in Paris and the annual car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, various communities are embracing innovative approaches to reduce their reliance on automobiles. These endeavors are not merely experimental; they form part of a broader movement termed "smart planning" aimed at creating more sustainable and environmentally friendly urban environments.

Vauban, a suburban community near Freiburg, Germany, serves as a remarkable example of the success of limiting car usage. In this upscale neighborhood, streets are entirely "car-free," with strict restrictions on parking spaces. Residents are allowed to own cars, but they face the inconvenience of limited parking, with only large garages at the edge of the development available for $40,000. Remarkably, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, with 57 percent having sold their cars to move there. The residents, such as Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, testify to the positive impact of this shift: "When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."

Similarly, major cities like Paris have implemented driving bans as a response to severe pollution, demonstrating the immediate benefits of reduced car usage. In Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced after days of near-record pollution, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion and a significant improvement in air quality. The ban targeted even- and odd-numbered license plates on alternate days, leading to fines for violators. The success of such measures highlights the potential for reducing pollution and mitigating environmental impact.

Bogota, Colombia, takes a more proactive approach with its annual car-free day, known as the "Day Without Cars." Millions of Colombians participate by walking, biking, skating, or taking buses to work, leaving the streets eerily devoid of traffic jams. The event aims to promote alternative transportation, reduce smog, and alleviate stress. Despite occasional rain showers, the turnout is consistently large, reflecting a growing awareness and commitment to sustainable mobility.

In the United States, the cultural shift away from car dependency is becoming apparent. Recent studies suggest a decline in car ownership, driving frequency, and the issuance of new licenses. This shift, often attributed to factors such as the recession, changing preferences, and advancements in technology, holds promising implications for reducing carbon emissions and promoting environmental sustainability. As Michael Sivak, a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute, notes, "Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift."

The advantages of limiting car usage extend beyond environmental benefits. The reduction of stress and the promotion of happiness, as experienced by residents in Vauban, challenge the notion that car ownership is synonymous with well-being. The shift towards more sustainable and healthier modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and public transit, is gaining momentum globally.

While the transition to a less car-dependent society may present challenges, the examples of Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and changing trends in the United States underscore the feasibility and desirability of limiting car usage. As the world grapples with the environmental consequences of widespread automobile use, these initiatives provide valuable insights into creating more livable, environmentally conscious communities. The future may indeed see a transformation in urban planning, with a focus on accessibility, sustainability, and the well-being of citizens over the convenience of cars.
