This upscale community, completed in 2006, has forbidden street parking, driveways, and home garages, leading to a car-free environment. The result is remarkable, with 70 percent of families in Vauban choosing not to own cars, and 57 percent selling their cars to move into the area. The positive impact on residents' well-being is palpable, as expressed by a resident, Heidrun Walter, who highlighted the reduction in stress and increased happiness associated with a car-free lifestyle (Rosenthal).

Beyond individual experiences, the move towards limiting car usage aligns with a broader global trend known as ""smart planning."" Suburbs like Vauban are pioneering efforts to separate suburban life from heavy auto use, acknowledging the significant role automobiles play in suburban living. With automobiles contributing to substantial greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in car-intensive areas, the need for alternative approaches to suburban development is urgent. As cities worldwide strive to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, the conventional model of spread-out homes with private garages is being reconsidered in favor of innovative urban planning that promotes sustainability and reduces dependence on cars (Rosenthal).

Paris provides another compelling case for the advantages of limiting car usage, particularly in response to environmental challenges. In the face of near-record pollution, the city enforced a partial driving ban, demonstrating a commitment to clearing the air. The results were tangible, with a 60 percent reduction in congestion and a noteworthy decrease in smog levels. While fines were imposed on violators, exceptions were made for eco-friendly vehicles, indicating a strategic push towards promoting environmentally conscious transportation.
