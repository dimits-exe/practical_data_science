	\section{Introduction}
	This report outlines results and conclusions drawn from the mechanical annotation of Greek and Greeklish YouTube comment data. The full report, detailing goals, data sources, methodology and implementation can be found at \url{https://github.com/dimits-exe/practical_data_science}.
	
	Our operational data have been collected by the top results of YouTube search for two categories: \textbf{Greek songs} and \textbf{Greek Gaming videos}. These categories represent two main demographics of the Greek online community: The older, middle-aged and the younger generations.
	
	
	\section{Language Identification Results}
	
	The main questions about our dataset are:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item How often is Greeklish spoken in circles of young and old people?
		\item How much do Greek and English users use emojis in comments?
		\item Do comments in Greeklish use emojis more often than comments in Greek?
		\item Is there any trend towards using Greeklish in the recent years?
	\end{itemize}
	
	Below, we present supporting graphs.

	\section{Toxicity Classification Results}
	
	In this section we include the results of the toxicity analysis on the crawled data. The toxicity levels are defined as a scale from 1 to 5 where 1: Not Toxic, 	2: Maybe Toxic, 3: Almost Toxic,	4: Almost certainly Toxic, 5: Certainly Toxic.
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Table \ref{tab::toxic_lang} shows a breakdown of average comment toxicity per language. 
		
		\item Table \ref{tab::toxic_videos} shows the videos with the most toxic comments, sorted by descending toxicity.
		
		\item Table \ref{tab::toxic_uniform} shows the videos where the comment toxicity remained uniform across time.
		
		\item Table \ref{tab::toxic_increasing} shows the videos where the comment toxicity increased over time, as well as the average rate of increase.
